The Irish government on Wednesday filed an appeal seeking to stop efforts by European authorities to force Apple to pay the country $14.3 billion to cover what antitrust officials say are unpaid taxes.Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s competition chief, ordered Apple in August to pay the amount, alleging the company had received preferential tax rulings from the Irish government that gave Apple an unfair advantage over rivals.Both Ireland and Apple deny any wrongdoing. The appeal, filed with the General Court, the top appellate court of the European Union, represents the beginning of a lengthy standoff between European authorities, the Irish government and Apple.“The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission’s analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal,” Michael Noonan, the country’s finance minister, told European politicians on Tuesday.There is much at stake for both sides.Ireland’s low tax rate and other financial incentives have attracted hundreds of foreign companies, providing thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of annual investment. Any restrictions on how Ireland can use its tax code, experts say, could seriously hamper the country’s growth and leave Apple with a multibillion-dollar tax bill to pay. The company plans a separate appeal.For European officials, the Apple tax ruling is the most visible of a series of cases against American companies accused of using Europe’s tax system to reduce their tax burdens unfairly. Lawmakers worldwide are trying to clamp down on complex tax structures that have allowed many multinational companies to significantly lower their tax liability.“We need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency,” Ms. Vestager said when announcing the tax clawback against Apple in August.Already, Starbucks has been fined roughly $34 million for an preferential tax deal in the Netherlands. McDonald’s and Amazon are likely to face similar charges in Europe in the coming months. All the companies deny they have breached Europe’s competition rules.For Apple and the Irish government, though, the tax battle is likely to drag on for years.Legal analysts say it will take up to 18 months for the General Court to rule on the matter. And any decision may be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the region’s highest court, further prolonging the uncertainty.
