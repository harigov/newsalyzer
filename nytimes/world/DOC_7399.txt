It had existed as a phrase for some time, but it wasn’t until two black men died in the summer of 2014 that Black Lives Matter began to flicker to life as a Twitter hashtag.The roots of the phrase are commonly traced to a July 2013 Facebook post by Alicia Garza, a California-based activist, but it appeared in the Twitter-friendly form #BlackLivesMatter only in fits and starts over the course of the following year, according to a Pew Research Center analysis on race and social media released this month.The hashtag had a small, but sustained increase in use in the summer of 2014, when Michael Brown and Eric Garner died in encounters with the police, focusing a national discussion on race and policing and elevating a phrase that would define a movement.“This is a very powerful example of how a hashtag now is attached to a movement, and a movement, in some ways, has grown around a hashtag — and a series of really painful and really powerful conversations are taking place in a brand-new space,” said Lee Rainie, director of internet, science and technology research at Pew.The label appears to have lasting power, simmering like a low-grade fever on social media and roaring to life with every police killing of a black citizen and every racial protest that makes the news, informing the long-running national debate.But it has also spurred fierce opposition under banners like All Lives Matter, White Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter (proffered by the supporters of police officers). On Sunday in Houston, for example, a White Lives Matter rally drew 20 people clutching Confederate flags and white supremacist symbols outside the N.A.A.C.P.’s headquarters to denounce attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La.In the report on race and social media, Mr. Rainie and his colleagues, led by Monica Anderson and Paul Hitlin, retraced the rise of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter over a period of nearly 1,000 days, from July 12, 2013, to March 31, 2016.The #AllLivesMatter hashtag generally tracked the ups and downs of its counterpart, but at a small fraction of the intensity, as shown in the chart below, based on the Pew data obtained using the social analytics software Crimson Hexagon.The data show that the deaths of Mr. Garner on July 17, 2014, and Mr. Brown on Aug. 9, 2014, marked an early and small turning point for #BlackLivesMatter, but the hashtag didn’t enter orbit until later that year.On Nov. 25, 2014 — three days after a Cleveland police officer fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice and one day after a grand jury declined to indict the officer who shot Mr. Brown — daily mentions of #BlackLivesMatter spiked drastically to 172,772, according to Pew.Mentions of the hashtag soared even higher days later. On Dec. 4, one day after a grand jury declined to indict the police officer whose chokehold led to Mr. Garner’s death, #BlackLivesMatter appeared 189,210 times on Twitter. It was mentioned 160,810 times the following day, too.Those events coincided with a lasting spike in the mentions of #BlackLivesMatter. In the three months leading up to Nov. 25, 2014, the hashtag averaged fewer than 1,500 daily mentions. In the three months after, it averaged more than 30,000.The hashtag enjoyed subsequent spikes, too. It was mentioned more than 120,000 times on the first anniversary of Mr. Brown’s shooting and more than 127,000 times on Oct. 14, 2015, one day after Senator Bernie Sanders, then a Democratic presidential contender, defended the movement during a campaign debate.The Pew study cut off at the end of March of this year, but the team behind the report later conducted a supplemental analysis covering two weeks in July when two black men were separately killed by police and eight police officers were killed in a pair of targeted attacks.What they found was a tremendous surge in the mentions of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter.On the day that Alton B. Sterling was fatally shot by police in Baton Rouge, La. — July 5 — #BlackLivesMatter was mentioned just under 10,000 times on Twitter. The next day, Philando Castile was fatally shot during a traffic stop in Minnesota and the hashtag spiked to more than 250,000 times. On July 7 — the day that Micah Johnson opened  an attack on Dallas law enforcement officers, killing five — #BlackLivesMatter appeared more than 850,000 times on Twitter.By July 8, the hashtag soared to more than 1.1 million mentions. On that same day, #AllLivesMatter appeared 189,000 times on Twitter — matching the record for #BlackLivesMatter during the entire earlier thousand-day study period.The number of mentions for both hashtags remained high in the days leading up to July 17, when three more officers were fatally shot in Baton Rouge.The July flurry of activity is notable not only for the level of discussion around the hashtag, but also for how the tone of the conversation changed, according to Pew.Over the course of the 1,000-day study period, 38 percent of #BlackLivesMatter mentions were positive, compared with 11 percent negative, according to a Pew sentiment analysis. The hashtag was used neutrally 12 percent of the time. (The remaining references fell into an “other” category.)And in the days leading up to the Dallas shooting, the tone was even more supportive: 87 percent of posts mentioning #BlackLivesMatter did so in a positive light, with just 11 percent of mentions appearing negative from July 5 to July 7.But that quickly and drastically shifted, with support falling to 28 percent and opposition rising to 39 percent in the 10 days after the Dallas shooting.“We really saw that shift overnight,” Ms. Anderson said. “It really shows you where current events can drive the conversation on social media and also change the tenor of conversation there, as well.”
