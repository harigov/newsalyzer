ITAGUÍ, Colombia — In his prison cell here on the outskirts of Medellín, Salvatore Mancuso reads Ghandi and self-help books. He taps notes to his lawyers into his BlackBerry. He gazes at photos of his 19-year-old wife and 8-month-old son. He listens to vallenato music on his iPod.And he meditates on the meaning of war."There are no good men or bad men in war,"  said Mancuso, 42, the Colombian  paramilitary warlord extraordinaire. "There are objectives, and the objective of war is to win by combating the enemy, and the enemy is not fought with flowers or prayer or song. The enemy is fought with weapon in hand, which produces dead men."As a commander and premier strategist for the death squads that committed some of the worst atrocities in this country's long internal war, Mancuso knows a lot about killing.He put into motion plans that transformed the paramilitary militias from an anti-guerrilla force into major cocaine traffickers and allies - some say masters - of high-ranking officials throughout the Colombian government.With that chapter of war ceding to a more subdued conflict, Mancuso now spends his days in prison alongside other paramilitary leaders as part of a deal to confess his crimes and pay reparations to his victims.The arrangement allows him to spend just eight years in confinement, and perhaps less, before re-emerging into society.Mancuso's confessions have fed the slow-burning scandal over revelations of ties between paramilitaries and a web of elite politicians, army generals and spies, almost all supporters of President Álvaro Uribe. In a country weary of war, Mancuso has become an uneasy reminder of how the conflict permeated so many areas of life."We were the mist, the curtain of smoke behind which everything was hidden," Mancuso, dressed casually in sandals and a black striped shirt and sitting in an ergonomic chair in his cell, said of the paramilitaries.A child of privilege, Mancuso grew up near the Caribbean coast, the son of an Italian father, a prosperous businessman, and a mother who had been "Cattle Queen" in a regional beauty contest. After high school, his parents sent him to study English at the University of Pittsburgh while taking a break from civil engineering studies.He returned to a country strained by guerrilla subversion, kidnappings and the rise of drug cartels. As a powerful cattleman by the mid-1990s, Mancuso formed a paramilitary organization ostensibly to protect the lives and property of his social class.His own warpath allowed him to extend his power, lording over the nebulous border region with Venezuela where the police in the frontier city of Cúcuta respond to Mancuso's authority to this day, according to Human Rights Watch, which has tracked his activities for a decade.Mancuso denies this, saying he leads a quiet life in prison. But he says he understands the motivations that would push some of 30,000 demobilized paramilitary fighters into shadowy new organizations that still carry out selective killings and export cocaine, describing them as "qualified labor."As Mancuso's star rose during the bloodiest days of the war, he coordinated the killings of at least 86 people, according to the attorney general's office in Bogotá. That number also corresponds to Mancuso's own confessions in recent months. In one of those sessions, he sobbed as he asked forgiveness for his crimes.Groups that represent the victims, who contend Mancuso oversaw hundreds of killings, see crocodile tears in such emotion. "It contradicts reality for someone like Mancuso to see themselves as heroes or martyrs," said Ivan Cepeda, the leader of a victims group whose father, a senator, was killed by paramilitaries. "This peace process is fictitious."The demobilization process is also in danger of collapsing. Other paramilitary leaders said they would halt their confessions this week following a Supreme Court decision viewing the militias as common, as opposed to political, criminals. The ruling could jeopardize the militia leaders' hopes to re-emerge into Colombian society after revealing details of their crimes before prosecutors and victims.Few things are as elastic as the truth as Colombia grapples with the fallout from its war, but Mancuso says he is prepared to set the record straight by writing a book about what took place during the conflict.Few people speak so clearly about the obstacles that prevent Colombia from moving beyond stalemate to peace.War, Mancuso would have Colombia believe, pushes its actors into unsavory options.So does the situation that passes for a semblance of stability these days, he says, pointing to the $5 billion in aid Washington has channeled to Colombia this decade to combat drug trafficking and insurgencies only to see cocaine exports flow unabated.The Colombian authorities, Mancuso said, "don't want to eradicate cocaine because the conflict generates so much international support that puts money on top of the table and allows so much money under the table in the form of corruption."Mancuso answers some compromising questions with only a smile, revealing, perhaps, that many uneasy truths have escaped his public confessions.Assessing Colombia's treatment of jailed paramilitary leaders, human rights activists fear Mancuso will avoid paying for his crimes in the form of extradition to the United States or extended prison sentences.Under Colombia's lenient rules, Mancuso could end up spending much less than eight years in a prison where he is already allowed amenities like satellite television in his cell, bodyguards, regular visits each weekend from his wife and son, and a laptop computer with Internet access, said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch."This is Uribe's gift to the leaders of paramilitarism," said Vivanco, referring to the criticism surrounding the policies of Uribe in relation to the militias.Mancuso shrugs off such statements, saying his change of life in prison has been "radical."
