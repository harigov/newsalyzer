Croatia is a popular vacation destination this year for travelers from the United States. Expedia has seen air ticket demand to the country double this summer, compared with last summer, and on the travel search engine Kayak, searches to Croatia between Jan. 1 and May 25 this year for travel from May 26 to Sept. 5 were up 25 percent, compared with the same periods last year.A holiday to Croatia, even during the peak season in August and September, doesn’t have to be expensive, according to Wanda S. Radetti, the owner of Tasteful Croatian Journeys, a company specializing in custom private trips to Croatia. “Despite the high demand for Croatia, you can find reasonably priced, nice accommodations and affordable group tours in beautiful, historic locales,” she said.Attractive airfare prices may be another incentive to consider Croatia: Data from Expedia indicate that airfare from the United States to both Dubrovnik and Split this summer is 30 percent lower than it was last summer.Options for Croatia trips in August and September include a seven-night getaway on the island of Vis, offered by WearActive, a company specializing in active trips.
