SHANGHAI — The former basketball star Michael Jordan filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Qiaodan Sports, a Chinese sportswear company, claiming unauthorized use of his Chinese name.In the lawsuit, the former Chicago Bulls guard accused the Chinese company of building a sportswear brand around the name he is known by in China — Qiaodan. Qiaodan tried to register trademarks using Chinese names that match those of Jordan’s two children, the lawsuit says.Jordan released a statement and a video saying he was suing because he was “deeply disappointed to see a company build a business off my Chinese name without my permission, use the number 23 and even attempt to use the names of my children.”Qiaodan, based in Fujian Province in southern China, had about $270 million in revenue through the first half of last year, and $45 million in profit.The company said Thursday that it was paying “close attention” to the case but that it had not received a notice of appearance from any domestic court.“In Chinese, ‘Qiaodan’ is a trademark registered by us according to Chinese laws and of which we enjoy exclusive rights,” it said. “The legal usage of this trademark is protected by Chinese laws.”In a prospectus the company filed with Chinese regulators in preparation for a planned public stock offering, Qiaodan said that it did not use Jordan’s image and that the company had exclusive rights to the registered trademark.The New York Knicks’ rising basketball star Jeremy Lin, an American whose family is from Taiwan, may face similar challenges in China, where counterfeiting and trademark infringement are common.A businesswoman in eastern China registered a trademark there for Lin’s name after seeing him play last year, according to local media reports.
