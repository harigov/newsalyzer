For the last four years, the asset-management giant BlackRock has dominated exchange-traded funds, the fastest-growing segment of the mutual fund industry.But while BlackRock, the world’s largest fund company, remains the undisputed market leader for mainstream E.T.F.s, smaller, nimbler firms are challenging it when it comes to introducing a new generation of E.T.F.s that track specific market segments.BlackRock took a significant step on Tuesday to bolster itself in this area by hiring Andrew Ang, a finance professor and advocate of an emerging investment style that singles out themes or factors, like value, momentum and quality of earnings.He will be a managing director and lead a new strategies group that will oversee $125 billion in client assets.The hiring shows the extent to which BlackRock is focusing more attention and resources on systematic approaches to investing as opposed to traditional styles, in which fund managers try to beat indexes.While BlackRock has been pulling in assets at an impressive rate, that has not been the case for actively managed equity funds, which have experienced $17 billion in outflows over the last year because of disappointing performance.Of the $4.7 trillion that BlackRock oversees, $3 trillion is managed in a systematic fashion through E.T.F.s or index funds.Factor-based investing, as it is known within the industry, has been providing the intellectual firepower behind the latest craze in E.T.F. investing — smart beta funds — where BlackRock is looking to expand aggressively.Traditional E.T.F.s track an index of stocks or bonds, like the Standard & Poor’s 500 or a basket of high-yield bonds. Because of their liquidity, transparency and low fees, these funds have become tremendously popular for individual and institutional investors and have contributed significantly to BlackRock’s growth in assets.Smart beta funds, on the other hand, will create a specially designed index that tracks a specific investment theme, like companies that pay the highest dividends or derive most of their earnings from exports, as opposed to the company’s size.Proponents of this approach argue that it incorporates the best aspects of passive investing — low fees, transparency and a clear set of rules — and active management.Fund companies like PowerShares — the E.T.F. unit of Invesco — and WisdomTree have attracted billions of dollars in recent years by offering these types of funds.WisdomTree, in particular, has been successful in this regard, with two of its currency-themed funds in Japan and Europe pulling in $40 billion.And while BlackRock has a full suite of smart beta funds that track a range of market segments, its chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, has not been shy about saying that he has greater expectations.“I do believe there will be more and more E.T.F.s that have some type of tilt or some type of smart beta component to it,” Mr. Fink said at an investment conference last month.But he also said he was “frustrated” that BlackRock was not “innovating fast enough.”Mr. Ang, who has written a book about his investment philosophy, thinks that instead of weighing traditional asset segments, like stocks versus bonds, or the United States versus Europe, investors should focus on factors that drive investment returns, like a company’s relative value and its ability to grow faster than its peers.“Factors are to assets as nutrients are to foods,” Mr. Ang said. “You create a diversified portfolio with low fees and transparency.”Mr. Ang, 42, who was raised in Australia, is a senior professor at Columbia Business School, where he specializes in asset management and capital markets.He has consulted for investment firms, pension funds and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund — making the case that a systematic investment approach that focuses on investment themes is superior to the more traditional approach.And while he says that the active model, in which fund managers try to beat the index, will not go away overnight, the trend, he thinks, is clear.“There will be a gradual shift,” he said, “from active managers to smart beta.”
