The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Friday that she was suspending investigations in Darfur because no arrests had been made in a decade and the United Nations Security Council had been unwilling to use its powers to help. The prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, left, said that given her limited resources and the lack of political will, she had no other choice, even as the decade-long violence in Darfur, in western Sudan, was worsening and government-run militias had stepped up attacks against civilians, especially women. Ms. Bensouda called for a “dramatic shift” in the Council’s approach and for “concrete solutions” to get arrests. In 2005, the Security Council asked the court to open a criminal investigation of Sudan’s campaign against civilians and rebel groups in Darfur. As a result, the court indicted President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, his defense minister and two other associates on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. But when the officials traveled abroad, other countries refused to arrest them. The court has no police force of its own, and the prosecutor’s complaints to the Council were ignored, she said. “We find ourselves in a stalemate that can only embolden perpetrators,” Ms. Bensouda said. The indictments, however, will remain in place.
