Iranian naval boats made dangerous maneuvers around United States warships in the Persian Gulf area on at least four occasions this week, Pentagon officials said Thursday, including one episode in which the Americans fired warning shots from a 50-caliber deck gun to prevent a collision.It was unclear whether the confrontations — one near the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday and three in the northern Persian Gulf on Wednesday — were deliberate efforts to send a hostile message about American naval activity.Still, they underscored the risk of an armed clash between Iran and the United States in an area that has been a perennial source of tension for the two countries.There was no immediate comment from Iran about Wednesday’s encounters. But its defense minister denied that Iranian vessels had done anything wrong in the Tuesday episode and accused the Americans of trespassing to provoke a response.Cmdr. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which is based in Bahrain, called the Iranian behavior on Wednesday a violation of international law and accused the Iranians of ignoring repeated warnings from the American vessels, creating a “dangerous, harassing situation that could have led to further escalation.”In a statement, Commander Urban said Wednesday’s episodes included two in which the Squall and the Tempest, American coastal patrol ships operating in international waters, were harassed by three boats from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, which crisscrossed the Tempest’s bow and created “a possible collision hazard.”Later, he said, an Iranian patrol vessel approached the Tempest head-on despite repeated radio, flare and loudspeaker warnings.“Ultimately, Squall resorted to firing three warning shots from their 50-caliber gun, which caused the Iranian vessel to turn away,” Commander Urban said.In the third episode on Wednesday, he said, the Stout, a guided missile destroyer, was harassed by the same vessel that had menaced the Tempest and the Squall. It crossed the Stout’s bow three times in an “unsafe intercept,” Commander Urban said, and the Stout maneuvered away and “employed devices,” which he did not identify, to dissuade the Iranian vessel from further harassment.Earlier, describing the Tuesday encounter, Cmdr. Kyle Raines, a spokesman for United States Central Command, said Revolutionary Guard patrol boats had repeatedly ignored warnings from two guided missile destroyers, the Nitze and the Mason, operating in international waters near the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit route to the Persian Gulf.The Iranians came within about 300 yards of the Nitze before veering off, Commander Raines said. Unsure of their intentions, the Nitze changed course several times to try to keep a safe distance from offshore oil rigs in the area.“We assessed the interaction as unsafe and unprofessional due to the Iranian vessels’ not abiding by international law and internationally recognized maritime rules of the road, as well as their high rate of closure of Nitze and disregard of multiple warnings by the ship’s whistle and flares,” he said.Responding to his complaint, Iran rejected the American version of events. The defense minister, Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, said in remarks quoted by the state news media that the Iranian boats patrolled only Iran’s territorial waters and had a mission to “counter any unintentional or aggressive intrusion.”The American naval presence in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz has prompted anger and resentment in Iran since the 1979 revolution that overthrew the United States-backed monarchy.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, often questions why the United States thinks it has the right to deploy warships near Iran. The Revolutionary Guards have also warned that they might close the Strait of Hormuz, although many outside analysts see that as an empty threat.Eugene Gholz, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas and a former Pentagon adviser, said of the naval confrontations, “I suspect that the dangers here are tied up in the overall relationship between the U.S. and Iran.”Even so, he said, “you do have to wonder why any country would want to send out small boats to approach another country’s warship in international waters at high speed, ignoring the target ship’s efforts to communicate.”In January, Iran briefly detained 10 American sailors whose patrol boats had strayed into Iranian waters, just before the international agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear activities took effect.
