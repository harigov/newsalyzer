Hot chocolate is one of those drinks so comforting that even bad hot chocolate still tastes good. Yes, there’s less joy in the powdered stuff than in a cup of homemade, but it will still sweeten the sting of the coldest, dreariest of days.This recipe is on the opulent end of the hot chocolate spectrum, as rich and satisfying as it gets. Heavy cream and milk mingle in the base, flavored with both bittersweet chocolate for depth and cocoa powder for tang, along with a little vanilla extract for its floral perfume.I could have stopped there and been thrilled with the contents of my cocoa cup. But a longing for something even more complex led me to add a pinch of chile powder and a cinnamon stick, a nod to the tradition in parts of Mexico.This hot chocolate is spicy in a gingerbread way, with a very mild chile bite. If you’re serving it to small children, you could skip the chile powder or reduce it to a pinch. Also good to note, the higher the percentage of cocoa solids in your bittersweet chocolate, the less sweet your brew will be. I used a 70 percent chocolate and it was just sweet enough. Or if you’re unsure and worried about oversweetening, just add the sugar at the end to taste.Then enjoy your cup of comfort, with a marshmallow, or without.Recipe: Spicy Hot Chocolate
