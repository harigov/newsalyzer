More than half a century ago, a 20-piece marching band in green and gold uniforms assembled near Track 37 at Grand Central Terminal to herald the arrival of what was hailed as an engineering marvel: the city’s first stainless-steel subway cars, known as Brightliners.On a recent rainy Thursday morning, as soggy passengers were huddled on a crowded platform waiting for the C train, those same cars were stuck.A signal problem had forced service to be suspended. Again. When the train finally arrived, the cars no longer seemed a gleaming symbol of modernity but instead, as they rattled and clanked along the deteriorating maze of tracks beneath the city, tin-clad markers of years of neglect.In fact, the C train cars, once the pride of the subway, are now, according to New York subway officials, the oldest in continuous daily operation in the world.As increasing delays and other problems in the city’s subway system have reached a breaking point, the story of why New York, the economic capital of the world, employs subway cars long past their expiration date is illustrative of many issues plaguing the region’s transit infrastructure and why fixes are hard. The tale of the Brightliners, and how difficult it has been to replace them, perfectly exemplifies the challenges, missed opportunities and lack of resolve — both political and financial — that have caused the system to arrive at the verge of collapse.And unlike the power substations or the signals or other vital parts of the underground infrastructure that routinely fail, the Brightliners are not hidden from view.Instead, for straphangers taking a bumpy ride on one of the old cars, they are like time machines transporting them back to an industrial past when the future of urban transit seemed full of possibility and potential — and a reminder of how long ago those days now seem.Keeping the 53-year-old trains running is not just an aesthetic problem. The cars, also known as the R32, break down far more often than any other train in the system, averaging just 33,527 miles between failures. The average subway car can travel 400,000 miles before breaking down. And the newest cars in the fleet average more than 750,000 miles.When a car breaks down, it can have a ripple effect that quickly radiates throughout the system and is one of the many reasons that riding the subway has become increasingly unbearable.The fact that the cars needed to be replaced was clear years ago, but other more pressing problems took precedence and subway officials chose to make stopgap repairs to keep costs to a minimum.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway as well as buses, commuter rails, bridges and tunnels, recently increased its capital budget to $32 billion as a response to both short- and long-term problems.But even as more money flows into the system, the story of R32 trains reflects how difficult it can be to move quickly to address the subway’s many pressing needs.Though funding for cars to replace the R32 was set aside years ago, the delivery of the new equipment is well behind schedule, tens of millions of dollars over budget and still more than a year from being fulfilled.Phil Eng, the newly named chief operating officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, acknowledged that the procurement system was flawed and said one of his mandates was to accelerate the process and look for savings.“It is not just the infusion of money but how we use that money,” he said.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the transportation authority, has been more vocal in acknowledging the severity of the problems facing the subway and is assuming greater responsibility for finding solutions.“It is no secret the New York City subway system is in dire need of upgrades and repairs, not only for the safety of commuters and visitors throughout the metropolitan area, but in order to meet the demand of travelers as ridership continues to grow,” he said in a recent speech.He announced a $1 million “genius transit challenge” open to anyone in the world “to find solutions that can be implemented with speed and efficiency.”Mr. Eng, who has been in the job two months, said, “We need to do more than just repair things and be reactive.”Richard Barone, the vice president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization, said public transit systems in other cities also have a mix of older and newer cars, but they are much more effective at refurbishing their old cars.“Unlike other systems, the M.T.A. does not give its cars a full midlife capital rehabilitation — it makes repairs to the critical systems — but does not gut and upgrade the interiors or exteriors and replace all mechanical systems,” he said. “This approach essentially rebuilds the cars, aside from structural age, making them almost new again.”Maryanne Roberts, a spokeswoman for Bombardier Transportation, the giant company that is providing the replacements for the R32, said one issue facing New York and every other metropolitan transit system is the patchwork nature of their networks.A subway car that might work in New York is not the same as one in Chicago or Boston. In other words, each must be custom made.In 2011, the problems with the R32 could no longer be ignored. Beyond their soaring failure rates, the trains were forced to switch from running on the C line in the summer to the J line, which would allow them to run outside and not put as much pressure on air-conditioning systems that were difficult to repair.In 2012, money was directed to replace the R32. Bombardier, one of only a handful of companies capable of filling the order, won the $600 million contract to build 300 new cars.But as Bombardier was building the cars to replace the R32, engineers in early 2014 discovered small cracks in weld joints.“We stopped production,” Ms. Roberts said. They had to find the cause, then agree with New York officials about the cause, then devise a solution, then work with the state officials to agree on the solution.It took about a year for production to start again.But it wasn’t long before there was another problem. In mid-2015, they discovered imperfections in the casting of a wheel unit manufactured by a subcontractor.Another year passed before work at a plant in upstate New York got underway again.Finally, last fall, Bombardier delivered 10 test cars to the city.However, there is only one test track currently in operation for New York’s entire subway system and the standard amount of time it takes to run all the needed tests is one year.Assuming no problems are found during the testing, the new cars will go into full production this fall and the order will be completed by September 2018.Mr. Eng said that the transportation authority was scheduled to open a second test track in June, which could cut the testing time for new cars by six months.Still, the old R32 cars will not be taken out of service right away.The authority is concerned that they will be needed in 2019, when it shuts down a tunnel under the East River to repair damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, disrupting L train service between Brooklyn and Manhattan.Tens of thousands of commuters will be seeking alternative routes and the old workhorse, stainless-steel Brightliners will be pressed into service yet again before they can finally be retired.
