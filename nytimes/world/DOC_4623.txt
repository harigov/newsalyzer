ATHENS — The Greek police raided a site near downtown Athens on Friday that would be the capital’s first state-sponsored mosque, arresting 15 members of nationalist groups that had been occupying the premises in protest.Athens is the only European Union capital without an official place of worship for Muslims, and although plans for the mosque predate the arrival of a huge of influx of migrants, many of whom are from Syria and Iraq, its construction has been caught up in the polarizing debate over how to handle the recent arrivals.Nationalist groups have complained that the increase in Muslims threatens traditional Greek values, while the leftist-led government and Mayor Giorgos Kaminis, of Athens, have insisted that the creation of the mosque is an obligation for Greece as a European Union member state.The protesters, who will face charges of disturbing the peace and have described themselves as patriots, moved to the plot of land in July to oppose the plans to construct the mosque, which was formally approved by Parliament in the summer after years of delays caused by protests and legal appeals. The project, budgeted at 887 million euros, or about $985 million, will be paid for by the Greek state.Though relatively small in size, the protest was a source of concern because it had picked up the support of far-right groups including the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, Greece’s third-largest party. According to the occupants, the site accommodated 20 homeless Greeks ages 17 to 74, and 45 “guards,” chiefly Greek Army reservists with right-wing views.They subsequently named their initiative the “homeless hostel,” saying they were providing food and shelter for destitute Greeks who have been neglected by the state at the expense of migrants who have been cared for at centers across the country.The protesters, many of whom wore their army uniforms on the site, a former navy facility, also set up a makeshift Greek Orthodox Church on the premises.Speaking by telephone before the raid, Christos Athanassiou of the Association of Reservist Infantrymen, one of the groups occupying the site, said the initiative was intended to help people who have been struggling because of Greece’s long-running economic problems. “We are not racists, we are patriots,” he said. “Our Greece is at risk.”Mr. Athanassiou said protesters were occupying the site legally, claiming they had gained approval from Greece’s human rights commission. A spokeswoman for the commission denied that assertion, saying that it did not have the authority to give such approval and, in any case, that it was not approached.The rhetoric used by the protesters is similar to that employed by Golden Dawn, whose leadership is on trial for charges that include racist attacks against immigrants.The protesters have denied any connection to Golden Dawn, but the mosque protest recently received a public embrace by the party. Its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, led a protest rally outside the plot on Sunday, and its spokesman, Ilias Kasidiaris, visited the site on Friday after the police raid, which was carried out peacefully.Mr. Kasidiaris condemned the police for dismantling the makeshift church on the site, while leaving hundreds of unofficial Muslim prayer sites in buildings across Athens untouched.The leftist-led coalition aims to Islamicize Greece, Mr. Kasidiaris said. “This will not pass,” he said. “Golden Dawn will make sure of it.”In a statement earlier this week, the general secretary of Greece’s Justice Ministry, Kostis Papaioannou, said the actions of the protesters were “reminiscent of past manifestations of hate which pose a threat to law, order and security.”Golden Dawn had distributed food in central Athens squares at the peak of the Greek crisis, but the handouts were restricted to Greek citizens, and they have since been banned.Greek society has been accepting of the migrants who continue to arrive in the country, and protests have been confined to areas close to overcrowded reception facilities, particularly on the islands in the Aegean Sea where migrants have been landing.The mosque project has not been opposed by the general public, with objections expressed chiefly by right-wing groups and Greek Orthodox clerics.The country’s influential Archbishop Ieronymos said this week that although he was initially supportive of an Athens mosque, he now believed that the project should be postponed until it was clear how many Muslim migrants would remain in the capital. He also expressed concern about “anti-Greekness and dechristianization.”
