South and North Korea agreed Tuesday to arrange for hundreds of relatives separated during the Korean War to meet siblings and other family members next month in those families’ first reunions in more than six decades. The 1950-53 Korean War — which was halted by a truce, not by a formal peace treaty — left the Korean Peninsula divided and numerous Koreans separated from their relatives. The so-called separated family members have never been allowed to exchange letters or meet each other, unless both governments arranged occasional reunions limited to a few hundred people. The last such reunions took place in February last year. After an overnight negotiation at the border village of Panmunjom, the two Koreas signed an agreement on Tuesday to hold a new round of family reunions at the Diamond Mountain resort in the southeast of North Korea on Oct. 20-26. The nations agreed in principle to a new round of reunions during an Aug. 25 deal to defuse a military showdown along the border.
