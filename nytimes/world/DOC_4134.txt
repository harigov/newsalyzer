WASHINGTON — After years of railing against the reams of regulations enacted during the Obama years, Republicans this week will zealously embark on an effort to roll back some of those rules using an obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act.Republican leaders have dusted off this rarely used legislation, added to their tool kit in 1996, to quickly reject recently finalized Obama-era regulations, many of which they say impose an excessive burden on American businesses.This week, the House is expected to use the Congressional Review Act to start the process of tossing out five rules, including one that limits the venting of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil- and gas-drilling facilities and another that requires federal contractors to report previous labor law violations.What is this law, and how will it be used? Let us fill you in.This law is intended to be an oversight tool for members of Congress, offering a check on federal agencies.Congress often delegates the power to carry out parts of laws to these agencies — giving them the authority to fill in the blanks. Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers have the ability to make sure that the agencies filling in the blanks are hewing closely to the spirit of the law.Though the time frame can vary, the law allows Congress at least 60 days to review a major rule before it goes into effect. During that period, lawmakers can object, and, if enough of them agree, eventually overturn it with the president’s signature.That is precisely what Republicans plan to start doing this week.Federal regulations dictate scores of things you encounter daily, like the nutrition label that says how much sugar is in breakfast cereal or the airwaves that transmit local radio stations.Proposed regulations generally undergo a lengthy review process that includes research, analyses and public input. But if a majority of lawmakers disagree with a rule — and the president signs off on their effort — the Congressional Review Act gives them a way to stop it in its tracks.As with other legislation, a majority in both chambers of Congress must pass a “joint resolution of disapproval,” as the measure rolling back a rule is called. The measure cannot be filibustered. Republicans hold a majority in both chambers.Yes, though it has been successfully used to overturn a regulation only once. In 2001, with the signature of former President George W. Bush, Congress rejected a rule on ergonomic standards from the Clinton administration’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Congress has passed five other joint resolutions of disapproval since the law was enacted in 1996, all under former President Barack Obama, according to the Congressional Research Service. He vetoed each of them.President Trump is highly unlikely to veto congressional Republicans’ efforts to roll back Obama-era regulations.Mr. Trump has said he will relieve what many in the business community denounce as an unmanageable regulatory burden. Shortly after he was sworn in, the White House froze recently completed and pending regulations; the Obama administration took similar action in 2009.Environmental regulations in particular have come under fire for increasing the cost and complexity of doing business, and conservatives in Congress have been eager to undo many of them.No, only the ones completed in recent months. According to Congressional Research Service estimates, lawmakers most likely could target any completed rules submitted to Congress on or since June 13, 2016.In addition to the rules on methane emissions and labor law violations, House Republicans are expected to target a rule that strengthens the permitting requirements and monitoring of coal mining operations that could pollute streams.Also on the agenda is a rule related to requiring companies to disclose payments made to the United States or foreign governments in order to commercially develop oil, natural gas or minerals.Republicans will also look to roll back a rule intended to block those with mental health disorders from being able to obtain a firearm. Under the rule, the government must identify those who receive disability benefits under Social Security and meet several other criteria, then report them to the attorney general to be included in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.One benefit of the Congressional Review Act is that it prompted the Government Accountability Office to post rules to a searchable online database.
