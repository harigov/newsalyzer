The biggest proxy fight against a company has begun, and it’s Procter & Gamble against Nelson Peltz.Mr. Peltz’s Trian unveiled a board challenge on Monday at the consumer products giant, the biggest company by market capitalization to face a formal proxy fight, highlighting the continued power of shareholder activism in the corporate world.Procter & Gamble had already rejected a demand from Trian to make Mr. Peltz a director, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported Trian’s plans. The investment firm owns roughly $3.3 billion worth of Procter & Gamble stock.The company has experienced sluggish sales growth and it had been under pressure from another activist investor, William A. Ackman.The company’s annual meeting is scheduled for the fall, later than many rivals’, and Mr. Peltz’s move adds to a list of activist campaigns in recent months:• Just weeks ago, Third Point set its sights on  Nestlé and pushed for it to sell its stake in L’Oréal.• Jana Partners pushed for change at Whole Foods and reaped the benefits when the grocery chain sold itself to Amazon.• Land and Buildings has pushed for Saks to consider selling its real estate.“Brexit” talks resume today, and David Davis, Britain’s top negotiator on the country’s departure from the European Union, has said he wants to “get down to business.”But Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet members appear busier with another task: fighting among themselves.The chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has accused hard-line supporters of Brexit of trying to undermine his efforts to set up a business-friendly departure process.The government is still divided over whether to seek a so-called soft Brexit, which Mr. Hammond has called for, or a clean break. Mr. Hammond wants the transition to last two years, while the trade secretary, Liam Fox, wants it to be a couple of months.“It depends how long we need to put in place new customs systems, new migration systems — these things can’t be magicked up overnight,” Mr. Hammond told the BBC on Sunday.The negotiations have brought other initiatives to a standstill, including a six-year push to impose a tax on financial transactions, as the European Union tries to redraw the financial map ahead of Britain’s departure from the bloc, Bloomberg has reported.Mr. Hammond, faced with reports that he was  deliberately trying to frustrate Brexit, said, “Some of the noise is generated by people who are not happy with the agenda that I have tried to advance over the last weeks, which is focused on protecting our economy, protecting our jobs and making sure we have continued rising living standards.”One major point of contention for the talks is Britain’s financial obligations to the European Union after it leaves.Last week, Britain acknowledged for the first time that it had obligations to the bloc that would “survive the U.K.’s withdrawal.”Mr. Hammond has said that Britain would “honor its debts.”Worth noting: With Mrs. May severely weakened after losing parliamentary seats in the general election last month, and with her cabinet embroiled in infighting, there are questions about how long she will remain in office. She has even managed to earn the sympathy of the former prime minister Tony Blair, who told Sky News that she was “surrounded by people who are just waiting for the moment they decide to throw her off the ledge.”Desktop Metal, a start-up that works on 3-D printing using metal, is to announce on Monday that it has raised $115 million in a new financing round.The start-up focuses on letting engineering teams quickly build complex metal parts for prototypes in their offices, instead of waiting for models to be machined or cast from metal.This round will bring Desktop Metal’s total fund-raising to $212 million. The company said the new money would help finance sales and international growth, and expand research and development.The round was led by GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, and New Enterprise Associates. Others in the round include:• GE Ventures• Techtronic Industries• Future Fund• Lowe’s• Lux Capital• Vertex Ventures• Moonrise Venture Partners• DCVC Opportunity• Tyche Partners• Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers• Shenzhen Capital Group• Saudi Aramco“We are on the brink of an exciting transformation in how metal parts will be designed, prototyped, and ultimately mass-produced,” Ric Fulop, Desktop Metal’s co-founder and chief executive, said in a statement.And Josh Wolfe, a co-founder of Lux, told DealBook: “We became early investors betting on Ric as a serial entrepreneur, a breakthrough tech and huge market potential, but now in awe of the fastest execution and momentum we’ve ever seen, we’re scaling up our funding, in a big vote of confidence, to match the scale of their ambitions.”Just as Amazon has revolutionized shopping, firms like Charles Schwab have been changing the investment industry by empowering wealth advisers who offer independent and conflict-free financial advice by relying on easy to use technology.Registered investment advisers sitting on more than $4 trillion in assets are posing a threat to the old model of huddling with brokers from Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley — for a hefty fee — and taking their advice on which stocks, bonds or mutual funds to buy.Brokers are leaving top Wall Street houses to establish independent shops, farming out back-office and custodial responsibilities to firms like Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity.Of the $2.9 trillion in assets that Charles Schwab oversees, $1.3 trillion comes from financial advisers — up from $863 billion in 2012. More than 7,500 registered investment advisers use Schwab to park assets. They can also call Schwab experts for help in setting up a business or for legal advice.The most crucial thing that a back-office firm offers advisers, though, is a sense of security. Being able to tell a client that the assets are with Schwab, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade offers a peace of mind that advisers say is critical to their business.“Without a good custodian,” said the Twitter-famous Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management, “none of what we do works.”
