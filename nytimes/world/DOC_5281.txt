On the first trading day of the new year, investors’ old worries flooded back.Global stock markets tumbled on Monday, as further fears about a slowdown in China’s economy reignited concerns about global growth.The selling on Monday started after China released a weak manufacturing report, and continued after the United States did the same. Chinese stocks lost nearly 7 percent of their value, although they appeared to stabilize Tuesday morning. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States stock market, posted a decline of 1.5 percent, while European stocks also fell.The sharp drops bring back memories of the sell-off last summer. China’s surprising decision in August to devalue its currency prompted concerns about the health of the country’s economy and helped ignite a global rout.But there was a new twist to investors’ anxieties. Measures to help steady stocks that were put in place after the market turmoil last year now appear to be exacerbating the selling in China.“This will be the theme for the year,” said Devendra Joshi, an HSBC Asia equity strategist. “There will be more volatility.”The market volatility, if it continues, may create headaches for the Federal Reserve, which in December raised interest rates for the first time in over nine years. The Fed chose not to raise rates in September, in part because it was concerned that the turbulence of the summer would weigh on the United States economy.The manufacturing data released on Monday could strengthen the arguments of some economists who say the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates. The Institute for Supply Management’s measure of manufacturing activity fell to 48.2 in December, its lowest reading since 2009. (A number below 50 signals that the manufacturing sector is contracting.)Chinese manufacturing has been steadily contracting for 10 straight months. The Caixin purchasing managers’ index for December fell to 48.2, well below expectations and lower than the reading in November.“It was a one-two punch from the manufacturing sector,” said Gina C. Martin Adams, institutional equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.Some of the stocks that soared in 2015 were among the hardest hit on Monday. Netflix, the top-performing stock in the S.&P. 500 last year, declined by almost 4 percent, while Amazon, the second-biggest gainer last year, plunged 5.8 percent.Investors also appeared to seek some safety in government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined slightly to 2.25 percent, from 2.27 percent.The oil markets shrugged off increased tensions in the Middle East. Early in the day, the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major oil producers, sent the price of crude soaring. But oil ultimately ended down, as concerns about the Chinese slowdown crimped commodity prices.Analysts cautioned that it would be a mistake to read too much into one day’s trading, and they pointed out that markets around the world rallied strongly after the sell-off in the summer. The outlook for Europe appears to be stronger than it was a year ago. And the United States economy has proved its resilience in recent years, growing even as the dollar increased in value and as the plunge in oil prices damaged the prospects of the energy sector.Still, China’s challenges will most likely unsettle investors for a while. As the world’s second largest economy, China is a critical piece of the growth puzzle. If China decelerates markedly, Chinese companies and consumers buy less in goods and services from other countries.Chinese demand is particularly worrisome for commodity producers around the world, which have been hurt by the country’s slowdown. On Monday, Anglo American’s shares fell about 7 percent, while Glencore’s were off 5.8 percent.The pressures on the Chinese currency add to the global worries.The Chinese government is allowing the value of its currency, the renminbi, to decline as a way of spurring its own economy. On Monday, the central bank set the renminbi at its lowest level since May 2011.But this approach risks fanning market tumult and trade tensions.Companies and individuals have moved their money overseas, prompted by economic weakness and the fear that the renminbi will lose more value. Those outflows further weigh on the value of the currency.“The People’s Bank of China needs to be careful,” said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. “It cannot create a one-way bet for renminbi depreciation. If they were to do that, we would run into an out-of-control scenario like we saw in the second half of last year.”From a trade perspective, China’s policy can prompt other countries to devalue their currencies to try to regain competitiveness. Some Asian countries have already moved in that direction.It is also a challenge for American companies. As other currencies have weakened, the dollar has remained relatively strong. That makes it harder for United States companies to export and it forces them to cut prices to compete — all of which potentially drags down earnings.The Chinese government’s stock stabilization plan is also playing into the market sell-off.A new rule, which went into effect on Monday, suspends trading in the major mainland markets when the CSI 300 index of blue-chip shares falls 5 percent during a session. The circuit breaker kicked in Monday, setting off a temporary halt. Analysts indicate that the suspension might have led investors to later dump shares, which then brought on a halt for the day.Another measure, a six-month ban on major shareholders’ offloading stocks in Chinese-listed companies, expires at the end of this week. The policy was imposed to stabilize share prices last summer. But now it could be having the reverse effect, leading those with smaller holdings to sell before larger shareholders do.After opening lower on Tuesday, shares in Shanghai wavered between small gains and losses.Hao Hong, chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, predicted that the tough start to 2016 could continue.“Volatility tends to beget volatility,” he said. “It will more likely than not spill over to other asset classes. Given we had such dramatic volatility, it’s really too early to see the bottom, especially now that the fundamentals are looking so ugly.”
