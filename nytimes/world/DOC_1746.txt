COLOMBIA — About a quarter-million children in Colombia have been displaced by fighting in the past three years of peace negotiations between the government and the country’s leading guerrilla group, the United Nations said in a report released Saturday.Roughly 1,000 Colombian children were used or recruited by nonstate armed combatants during the same period, according to the report by Unicef, the United Nations Children’s Fund.The report also said roughly 200 children were killed or wounded in attacks or from land mines or other explosives in the past three years, and nearly 200 were victims of sexual violence.Unicef released the report as negotiators worked against a March 23 deadline to reach a final agreement to end a half-century of war in Colombia, regarded as the longest active conflict in modern history.More than 220,000 people have been killed in the war, which has pitted government forces against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. Nearly six million people have been displaced.The use of children in armed conflicts is a problem in many areas of the world, but has been especially so in Colombia, where the FARC has been accused of systematically recruiting and training children since its inception in the 1960s.Last month FARC negotiators promised to end the practice as part of a broader effort to reach a peace agreement.The United Nations and international rights groups regard a child as anyone younger than 18.“No child in Colombia today knows what it is like to live in a country at peace,” Roberto De Bernardi, Unicef’s representative in Colombia, said in the report.Even if a peace agreement is reached, Mr. De Bernardi said, he feared that children would still face risks “from all kinds of violations including recruitment, land mines and sexual exploitation.”
