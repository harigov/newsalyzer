AMMAN, Jordan — Members of the political arm of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood won seats in Jordan’s Parliament in a symbolic comeback, and women increased their numbers in the legislature, according to results of parliamentary elections released on Thursday.Although most of the 130 seats in the lower house of Parliament were retained by pro-monarchy loyalists, the Islamic Action Front, the Brotherhood’s political arm, and other Islamists not affiliated with the Brotherhood won a total of 16 seats.The Brotherhood had boycotted the last two elections to protest what it said were unfair practices in the electoral system that favored pro-government candidates. Jordan had stripped the Brotherhood of its official registration this year, but the Islamic Action Front remained registered and legal. The group decided to field candidates this time after the government adopted changes that encouraged the participation of political parties and opposition groups.Jordan’s lower house of Parliament has limited political power or influence over the government’s policies. King Abdullah II appoints the prime minister, cabinet members and members of the upper house of Parliament.The lower house, however, will seat 20 women, a record for Jordan. According to a quota system, 15 seats were reserved for women, but five other women won competitive races outside the quota system, according to the official results.“It is an achievement, but some women organizations would argue that it is not at the level they had hoped for or expected,” said Jihad Momani, a spokesman for the Independent Elections Committee.Jordan is struggling to handle hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled violence in Syria and Iraq. The United States is providing $1.6 billion this year to help Jordan cope with the crisis, making it one of the top recipients of American foreign aid.
