The Cleveland police officer who fatally shot a 12-year-old boy last month left the police force in nearby Independence, Ohio, after an internal assessment two years ago found that he had suffered a “dangerous loss of composure” during firearms training. The officer, Tim Loehmann, is now under investigation after shooting Tamir Rice within two seconds after the patrol car in which he was riding pulled up next to the boy, who had what turned out to be a fake gun. The previous assessment, first reported by The Cleveland Plain Dealer, found that Officer Loehmann “could not follow simple directions, could not communicate clear thoughts nor recollections, and his handgun performance was dismal.” Cleveland police officials said they had not reviewed Officer Loehmann’s Independence personnel file during their hiring process, but had been told by that city’s human resources director that there were no disciplinary actions against him or other incidents that they needed to be aware of.
