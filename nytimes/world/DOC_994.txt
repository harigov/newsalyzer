LONDON — It is a long stretch from the trenches of the Great War to the salons of haute couture. But camouflage  -  the disruptive patterns that break up the body shape or blend in with surroundings  -  has made that leap.And looking at its origin as an artistic experiment by people more familiar with a paint brush than a gun, the art and craft of the so-called "Camoufleurs" takes on a different perspective.It may have taken hours of intense work to create the chiffon ball gown, trimmed like topiary and with the now-familiar green and brown foliage pattern. But Jean Paul Gaultier's couture work is nothing compared to the task of painting an entire battleship with a "dazzle" pattern, invented in the 1914-18 war."Camouflage" at London's Imperial War Museum (until Nov. 18; www.iwm.org.uk/camo) is as much an eye-opener as the original inventors meant their painted splotches to be visual concealment.Divided into different categories, such as "Distort," "Deceive" and "Advertise," this fascinating exhibition is the first to take camouflage out of its military context and trace its origins from the 19th-century studies of protective coloring in animals, through the idea of  making  soldiers' uniforms blend in, rather than flag their colors. Ultimately, there was an urgent need to protect armies from the "eye in the sky": aerial reconnaissance.Most intriguing is the link of camouflage to Cubism and its breaking down of the body in modern art. Picasso exclaimed on seeing a camouflaged canon in Paris: "It was us who created that." While in conversation with Jean Cocteau, he said: "If they want to make an army invisible at a distance, they only have to dress their men as harlequins.""Camouflage was influenced by Cubism and different ways to deconstruct, adding colored shapes and breaking up the recognizability," says James Taylor, the exhibition's curator.Calling himself  "of the post-Punk generation," Taylor has traced the  patterns from the elite army forces such as British paratroopers and Germany's Waffen-SS  to street style.By the time Vietnam veterans wore camouflage uniforms to protest the war and Andy Warhol turned broken patterns into vivid pictures (adapted as clothing patterns by the  American designer Stephen Sprouse), the art of war had moved into Pop Art.The ultimate absorption of camouflage into popular culture is shown in the exhibition by rockers from the Eurythmics and the hip hop group Public Enemy adopting the "uniform" and by the street style clothing from Maharishi  -   on sale in the museum's shop."Camouflage," by Tim Newark (published by Thames and Hudson), adds further nuances to the story of camouflage. A fascinating essay by  Jonathan Miller discusses the creatures of the natural world apparently absorbing the visuals of  their surroundings from the "silvering" of fish to the variegated colors of insects and mammals. Tracing early scholarly studies back to Sir Edward Poulton's "The Colours of Animals"  in 1890, Miller explains that these markings are the "unplanned results of natural processes"  -  not a conscious  intention to conceal.Markings from the natural world are behind many of the camouflage effects that were first invented by the French artist Lucien Victor Guirand de Scévola in 1918. They were followed up by leopard spots splattered by hand on khaki uniforms. (The word "khaki" itself  is a translation via  Urdu from Persian of "dust-colored" and the material was introduced to the British Army in the Punjab in 1846).Each country drew on its visceral feel for nature, with the Germans taking patterns from their noble forest heritage  -  not to mention the American military inventing a chocolate chip cookie pattern!A large vitrine of uniforms at the show moves to fashion creations, while  a split screen shows simultaneously military maneuvers and models wearing camouflage on the runways.The disruptive patterns are spread between bellicose and beautiful, with images of Venezuelan paratroopers with their skin camouflage painted  at the same time as John Galliano and Yohji Yamamoto were whipping the pattern into graceful gowns.Yet even in the most aggressive images, there is a kind of beauty: a German helmet with its round surface broken up by color; a Russian  jacket with a leafy summer pattern. And proving that war can be a catalyst for pleasure, the "dazzle" naval camouflage and Cubist harlequin patterns were the inspiration for a costume ball in 1919 as the Great War ended.
