STATION DES ROUSSES, France — Speeding away on a narrow mountain road more suited to goats than to riders, Lilian Calmejane won Stage 8 to the Rousses ski station in the Jura Mountains on Saturday for his first victory in his first Tour de France.Calmejane, riding for the French team Direct Energie, fought cramps after breaking away on the final climb and hung on, tongue lolling, for victory in only the second visit by the Tour to Rousses. It was the second win at this Tour for a French rider, after Arnaud Demare’s in Stage 4.The Tour leader, Chris Froome, finished in a group further back, retaining the yellow jersey ahead of a second, far harder day of climbing, again in the Jura Mountains, on Sunday.Froome’s day was not without incident: On a downhill right-hand bend after the second of three notable climbs on the stage from Dole, Froome, a three-time Tour champion, went straight into the roadside grass instead of cornering, but managed to stay on his bike and quickly recover.Calmejane held off the Dutch rider Robert Gesink on the final climb and rolling finish. Cramping from his effort, Calmejane had to slow and rise off his saddle to stretch his legs in the final section, then gritted his teeth to the finish line.Gesink, of the Netherlands’ Lotto-Jumbo team, rode in 37 seconds after Calmejane. The French rider Guillaume Martin placed third on the stage, 13 seconds farther back.“Winning alone like that is incredible,” said Calmejane, who also won a stage at his first Grand Tour, the Spanish Vuelta, last year. “It’s everything I dreamed of.”
