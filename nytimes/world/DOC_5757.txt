Shrews are noisy little mammals, and among their vocalizations are faint high-pitched twittering sounds. Some research has suggested that shrews might use these sounds for echolocation —  like bats, only simpler.Studying common and greater white-toothed shrews, Bjorn M. Siemers of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and colleagues reasoned that if the twittering was useful for echolocation, then it should vary based on the habitat. If  the sounds were used only for communication, then the calls should vary based on whether  other shrews were around.Simulating the presence of  other shrews,  the researchers found no variation in the calls. But by altering the habitat — putting down increasingly thick layers of straw — they found that the calls increased. In field experiments, they played  shrewlike sounds in  shrew habitats like meadows and forest floors and found that they produced distinct echoes. The study appears in Biology Letters.The findings suggest that the shrews may indeed use these calls for echolocation — sonically examining  their surroundings and analyzing the reverberations to determine the nature of a particular location and how best to travel through it.
