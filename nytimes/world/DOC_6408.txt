LE BOURGET, France — One of the largest gatherings of world leaders in history began a multinational effort Monday toward forging what many called the planet’s last, best hope to stave off the worst consequences of climate change.“Never have the stakes of an international meeting been so high, since what is at stake is the future of the planet, the future of life,” President François Hollande of France told a packed United Nations plenary session at a convention center in this suburb north of Paris.Over the next two weeks, 30,000 diplomats and delegates will labor to hammer out a new global pact that would, for the first time, commit nearly every country on earth to enact new policies to reduce their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.The talks were kicked off by world leaders including President Obama, President Xi Jinping of China, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as well as leaders from smaller nations and those most endangered by the effects of rising temperatures.Many remarked upon the urgency of the task — but also upon a new optimism that a successful deal could be closer at hand than ever before, despite significant obstacles in the days ahead.The Paris talks represent the culmination of more than 20 years of efforts to enact such a deal, including two previous meetings of world leaders. Both of those gatherings — in Kyoto in 1997 and in Copenhagen in 2009 — ended with documents that were ultimately viewed as failures.New scientific reports show that the destructive effects of climate change have already begun to sweep the planet, with the global economy firmly on track to produce a level of emissions that would lock in a future of rising sea levels, intense droughts and food shortages, more destructive storms and floods, and other catastrophic effects.If the Paris talks collapse or end in failure, it may be many years before world leaders try to negotiate a similar deal.Already, a series of analyses have concluded that the best deal that could emerge from Paris would most likely cut emissions by only about half the level needed to avert the worst effects. That would leave a Paris deal as a step forward to solving climate change, but not the solution in and of itself.In past, failed efforts to strike such a deal, the United States and China, the world’s two largest greenhouse gas polluters, have negotiated as adversaries. But after striking a bilateral deal last year to jointly reduce emissions, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi urged their counterparts to join them in solving the problem — a sharp contrast from what has come before.Mr. Obama said that the United States was at least partly to blame for the life-threatening damage that environmental change has wrought.“I’ve come here personally, as the leader of the world’s largest economy and the second-largest emitter,” Mr. Obama said, “to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it.”Mr. Obama also repeated an argument, lampooned by some Republicans, that the climate conference was a fitting response to the terrorist attacks that cost the lives of 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13.Shortly after his arrival on Sunday night, Mr. Hollande greeted Mr. Obama, and the two paid a surprise late-night visit to the Bataclan, the concert hall where dozens of people were killed in the coordinated series of attacks.On Monday morning, Mr. Obama met with Mr. Xi as China and other parts of Asia and the Indian subcontinent were experiencing high levels of particle pollutants, leaving cities and suburbs submerged in dense smog.Citing climate change as “a huge challenge,” Mr. Xi said it was “very important for China and the United States to be firmly committed to the right direction of building a new model of major country relations,” including by “partnering with each other to help the climate conference deliver its expected targets.”Sitting beside Mr. Xi at the end of a long table, Mr. Obama said in remarks made before reporters that the partnership on climate discussions — despite a host of differences on issues including cybersecurity and military presence in the South China Sea — had been an essential part of the prelude to the global conference.Still, huge hurdles remain ahead of striking a deal, which must be agreed to unanimously by the nearly 200 countries in order to be legally binding.The greatest threat to reaching a binding climate accord may be a loose coalition of developing nations, led by India, who argue that they should not be asked to limit their economic growth as a way of fixing a problem that was largely created by the others. Mr. Obama conceded that point.With India the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas polluter, Mr. Obama has invested heavily in his relationship with Prime Minister Modi in hopes of securing his cooperation for a deal here.Mr. Modi said that poor nations had the right to burn carbon to grow their economies.“Climate change is not of our making,” he said at a speech opening the dazzling Indian pavilion here. “It is the result of global warming that came from the prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel.”He added: “But, we in India face its consequences today. We see it in the risks of our farmers, the changes in weather patterns, and the intensity of natural disasters.”“That is why the outcome in Paris so important.”Mr. Modi has insisted that emissions reductions in his country must be paired with billions of dollars of investment by the developed world into helping poor countries make the transition from fossil fuel to cleaner forms of energy. On Monday, he announced, with Mr. Hollande, an international alliance to promote greater use of solar energy in the 121 solar-rich nations.While it remains uncertain whether Mr. Modi will sign on to a final deal, there was evidence of a shift in tone from some other major world leaders. Justin Trudeau, the new prime minister of Canada, tried to signal an about-face from the stance of his predecessor, Stephen Harper, who had strongly opposed climate change policies.Canadians have demonstrated “a strong desire” to take action on climate change, Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Paris.Even Mr. Putin, who has in the past expressed skepticism about the established science of climate change, reflected the tone of the day. Russia, a petrostate that relies heavily on the production of fossil fuels, had previously been viewed as a likely obstacle to a final deal.“Climate change has become one of the gravest challenges humanity is facing,” he said. “Russia has been contributing actively to addressing global warming.”Besides the officials from all over the world, the event is expected to get a lift from prominent business leaders and philanthropists. Some of them are using the talks to announce substantial donations to help the cause of reducing emissions, developing alternative energy sources, conservation, and aiding poor and low-lying countries expected to be most affected by climate change.The Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group of business and philanthropy executives led by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who have a combined total of $350 billion in private wealth, has pledged to invest in moving clean-energy technologies from laboratories to the marketplace.It is hoped that the pledge, along with one by 19 countries, including the United States, to double their investments in energy technologies to $20 billion by 2020, will help convince poor countries that they will be given significant help in making a transition to a new economic model that relies less on the use of carbon.In one of many such expected announcements, the State Department pledged $248 million to help the world’s least-developed countries move toward a future that is less reliant on carbon.However, such efforts — as well as Mr. Obama’s pledges — will continue to meet opposition in Congress. Republicans have vowed to block or overturn much of Mr. Obama’s efforts here, and the House is scheduled to vote later this week on two bills that would halt Mr. Obama’s domestic climate change policies.The president is hoping that the international pact will outlive any future leader, although fervent opposition in the Senate means that any agreement here will not be a formal treaty, which would need approval from lawmakers.
