KUNDUZ, Afghanistan —  At least 29 people were killed and 19 others wounded in a suicide bombing targeting a militia in the northern province of Kunduz, Afghan officials said Sunday.The deadly attack late Saturday came a day after a wave of bombings rocked the Afghan capital, killing at least 65 people and wounding hundreds of others. The attacks are being seen as a sign that Taliban forces are escalating violence after a brief lull attributed to internal divisions that followed the confirmation of the death of the group’s longtime leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, at the end of July.The target of the attack in Kunduz was a militia commander called Qadir, who controls about 100 men, according to Hayatullah Amiri, the governor of Khanabad, a district in Kunduz. The bombing took place as Mr. Qadir, who uses one name, and his men were leaving a meeting.As part of a Taliban offensive in the north that has caught the Afghan government off guard, large parts of Kunduz Province, including its capital city, have come under Taliban fire in recent months. The sudden escalation of violence has forced the Afghan government to rely on militias that were supposed to have been disarmed in a program paid for with hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid.A small sub-unit of Mr. Qadir’s militia was fighting on behalf of the government in an area of Kunduz recently overrun by the Taliban, Mr. Amiri said.
