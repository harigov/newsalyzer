WASHINGTON — President Obama announced Monday that he would nominate Robert Stephen Beecroft, a career diplomat, as the next ambassador to Iraq after his first choice was forced to withdraw after the disclosure of racy e-mail messages.Mr. Beecroft is now the No. 2 American civilian official in Baghdad and therefore already set to run the embassy temporarily until the Senate votes on his confirmation. With the presidential election less than two months away, the White House calculated that a more political selection would be problematic.Mr. Obama’s first nominee, Brett H. McGurk, withdrew his name in June after suggestive e-mail messages he sent while working in Baghdad to a reporter from The Wall Street Journal were posted on a Web site. Mr. McGurk had since married the reporter, but Democrats were unwilling to defend him because he previously worked for President George W. Bush.Before moving to Baghdad last year as the deputy chief of mission, Mr. Beecroft was ambassador to Jordan. He also worked as the executive assistant to two secretaries of state during the Bush administration, Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice.The announcement came at a delicate moment in Iraq as the country’s Sunni vice president was convicted of murder and sentenced to death and a wave of insurgent attacks threatened to deepen a political crisis.
