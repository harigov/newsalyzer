Q. Facebook starts to play videos automatically and loudly when I use the Android app. How do I make it stop?A. Facebook announced this year that it was making changes to the way videos work on its service, particularly for mobile devices. In a blog post that explained the new features, the company said that mobile users “had come to expect sound when the volume on their device is turned on” and that it heard positive feedback about the audible autoplay behavior.The sound of the videos fades in and fades out as you scroll through your News Feed, and the videos are not supposed to be audible at all if you have the main volume level on your phone set to silent. However, if you prefer to keep your phone’s volume set to a normal level and do not want Facebook videos blaring in public when you browse your news feed, you can disable the function in the app’s settings.In the Android version of the Facebook app, tap the three-lined menu button in the toolbar and scroll down to App Settings. Next to “Videos in News Feed Start With Sound,” tap the button to the Off position. If you do not want videos in your feed to play automatically at all, tap Autoplay toward the bottom of the list and tap “Never Autoplay Videos” on the next screen before leaving the Settings area.In the iOS version of the Facebook app, tap the three-lined menu icon in the corner of the screen and choose Settings. Select Account Settings and then Sounds. Turn off the button next to “Videos in News Feed Start With Sound.” You can find the preferences for autoplay videos in the Videos and Photos section of the main Settings screen.
