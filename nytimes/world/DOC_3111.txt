President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan — indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity — will not attend a meeting in Saudi Arabia alongside President Trump, the Sudanese state news agency said on Friday.A Saudi invitation to Mr. Bashir had outraged human rights advocates, who called it a breach of longstanding United States policy.Mr. Trump is scheduled to arrive on Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he will be the guest of honor at the meeting. His aides say he will give a major speech on American relations with the Islamic world, a counterpoint to President Obama’s 2009 speech in Cairo.The United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court, but it has long sought to ostracize defendants who defy the court’s arrest warrants, including Mr. Bashir, who has led Sudan for nearly three decades.Mr. Bashir was indicted in 2009 and 2010 on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region of Sudan. In refusing to honor the indictments, he has come to symbolize impunity toward the court, which is based in The Hague.The Sudanese state news agency SUNA said that Mr. Bashir would not attend the meeting “for personal reasons,” but it did not elaborate.
