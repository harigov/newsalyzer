To the Editor:Re “Entertainment at Mar-a-Lago? Security Talks” (front page, Feb. 14):Surely there is a private dining room at Mar-a-Lago where President Trump could have discreetly played host to Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan. However, allowing club members to see what power looks like not only feeds Mr. Trump’s narcissism but also enhances the Trump brand financially, making those $200,000 memberships worth the price.Having a crisis on full public display and the nuclear “football” — the briefcase with the nuclear codes — available for photo ops were just more of the same, there seemingly being no limits to how low he will stoop.This explains why, as Michael J. Morell, former acting C.I.A. director, said, no other president he has known would have conducted a potentially classified discussion in a public space; the other presidents had nothing to sell.If only a president could be impeached for a lack of class, our national nightmare could soon be over.PERRIE L.
