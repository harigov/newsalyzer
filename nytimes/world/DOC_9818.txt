For nearly two decades, Takata has struggled to tame an inexpensive but unstable compound thought to play a central role in airbag ruptures that are linked to at least five deaths and dozens of injuries.As far back as June 1995, a patent application filed by Takata expressed concern over using the compound, saying that it was so vulnerable to temperature changes that its casing, under excessive pressure, “might even blow up,” a review of patent documents by The New York Times found.Still, Takata said that it could stabilize the compound, ammonium nitrate, according to the patent document. By 2001, Takata had started to use ammonium nitrate in its propellant, which generates the gases to inflate the airbag.This year, airbags made by Takata, one of the world’s major suppliers, have become the focus of a growing global safety crisis, with more than 16 million vehicles worldwide from 11 automakers recalled. The airbags can explode violently when they deploy, sending metal debris flying into the cabin.Takata has said in congressional testimony that it began an investigation into airbag ruptures in 2007 and has attributed them to manufacturing flaws in the propellant, problems it says it has since fixed. Takata continues to use ammonium nitrate in the replacement airbags, and says the airbags are safe.“The ammonium nitrate that we are using, it’s safe and stable,” Hiroshi Shimizu, Takata’s chief quality officer, said at a congressional hearing last week.But as recently as December 2013, Takata filed a patent application that points to lingering concerns over the compound’s vulnerability to moisture and changes in temperature.A Takata spokesman said the company had many reasons to use ammonium nitrate in its airbags.“Ammonium nitrate-based propellant has significant advantages over other inflater propellants,” Alby Berman, a spokesman, said in a statement. It releases fewer toxic emissions, is more efficient, allowing for smaller inflaters, and is safer to manufacture, he said.Scott Upham, who was a senior manager at Takata in the mid-1990s and is now a consultant, said the patent documents showed that the company had long been aware of the risks associated with its choice of propellant, and that those risks had not been fully resolved.“Takata clearly knew there were severe issues with the use of this product from very early on,” Mr. Upham said. “The patents really document how they’ve tried to fix the propellant. And they still haven’t solved some of the fundamental problems with it.”The use of ammonium nitrate has caught the attention of lawmakers and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has ordered Takata to produce documents related to its use of the compound, and to detail every time it has changed its composition.There are many reasons that companies pursue patents, experts say, from developing new products, to simply experimenting with alternative technologies. In many instances, the patents are never put into use.Takata’s struggle with ammonium nitrate dates to the 1990s, when airbag manufacturers raced to find alternatives to a compound used at the time called sodium azide, which could produce toxic fumes.Takata initially replaced sodium azide in its airbag propellant with a mixture based on a fuel called tetrazole, according to patent filings and news releases at the time.But as competition in the airbag industry intensified, concerns over tetrazole’s cost and its uncertain supply spurred Takata to turn to ammonium nitrate, which is commonly used in construction and mining, according to Mark Lillie, a former Takata engineer, who said he raised concerns at the time.Early patents filed by Takata echo those concerns, which relate to the sensitivity of ammonium nitrate to temperature changes, and to moisture.“One of the major problems with the use of ammonium nitrate is that it undergoes several crystalline phase changes,” says a Takata patent filed in June 1995 by the company’s research lab in Farmington Hills, Mich., the Automotive Systems Laboratory.One of those phase changes, the patent application points out, occurs at approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and is accompanied by large changes in volume to the propellant, which is placed in airbag inflaters in the form of wafers or tablets that resemble aspirin pills.A central point of contention between Takata and regulators is the company’s refusal to expand some of its airbag recalls, issued this year, beyond limited geographic areas associated with high heat and humidity. Takata says it is still searching for the root cause behind recent airbag ruptures in those regions.If ammonium nitrate propellant were to cycle through those temperature changes, the patent application says, the compound would “expand and contract and change shape resulting in growth and cracking” of the propellant. That result is “totally unacceptable,” the document says, because the inflater might “not operate properly or might even blow up because of the excess pressure generated.”Still, in that and subsequent patent applications, Takata’s engineers explain that ammonium nitrate can be stabilized by using other substances, like potassium. A patent application filed in November 1996 says that using properly stabilized ammonium nitrate makes the propellant “relatively more stable and less explosive.”Another patent application, filed for an inflater in August 2000, lays out the changing economics of airbag manufacturing. New regulations that required automakers to fit all new vehicles with airbags had intensified the search for a lighter, less expensive inflater, the document says.In the years that follow, the patent documents show, Takata engineers continued to propose more ways to stabilize its propellant. After 2005, however, its patents began to shift their focus to concerns over moisture.In one patent application, filed in October 2006, Takata explained that moisture could seep into the propellant both during manufacturing and once the inflater was placed inside the car. It said stress tests showed that without adding moisture-absorbent material to the propellant, the inflater “ruptured due to extremely high internal pressures.”Despite the drawbacks, Takata continued to believe ammonium nitrate was its best alternative.“Takata has always understood the effects that moisture may have on the combustion characteristics of ammonium nitrate,” Mr. Berman said, “but phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate based-propellant is safe and effective for use in airbag inflaters when properly engineered and manufactured.”Jimmie Oxley, an explosives expert at the University of Rhode Island, said that all airbag manufacturers struggled at the time to find the perfect propellant, powerful enough to inflate an airbag in microseconds without generating toxic fumes and durable enough to remain stable in a car for years.“In one sense, ammonium nitrate is a beautiful compound,” Dr. Oxley said, because it is not toxic and doesn’t generate harmful fumes. “The problem with ammonium nitrate is that it doesn’t have high temperature stability. But a car may go to northern Canada, or it may go to the Equator, or to Phoenix, Ariz.,” she said.“You also have to seal it up, work really hard to keep it dry,” she said. “And it’s there for the life of the car, which is a pretty strong requirement for a chemical to have.”Other companies also looked at ammonium nitrate and even received patents of their own. But the biggest airbag manufacturers have said they do not base their propellant on ammonium nitrate.Autoliv warned in a patent application in January 2003 that ammonium nitrate’s sensitivity to temperature changes could render the compound “unacceptable” for typical airbags. That filing also pointed out that keeping ammonium nitrate sufficiently dry “is generally impractical for most manufacturing situations.”Takata’s efforts to protect its airbag propellant against moisture continued to at least December 2013.In a patent application that month, Takata engineers again warned that temperature changes inside the inflater may cause the propellant to “lose density especially in the presence of moisture or humidity.” They put forward yet another fix: coating the propellant pellets with paraffin to try to protect the ammonium nitrate mixture. That patent application is still pending.
