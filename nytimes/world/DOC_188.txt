WASHINGTON — President Trump said early Tuesday that Democrats and “a few” Republicans were at fault for the collapse of health care legislation in the Senate, and he restated his strategy to let the Affordable Care Act “fail.”In a pair of morning tweets, Mr. Trump said, “We will return,” but he provided no specifics.Senate Republicans’ hopes for a health care bill died Monday night when two Republican senators said they would oppose their party’s bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, leaving the Senate at least two votes short of what would be needed to start the debate on the proposed law.On Monday night, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said that “the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful.”He described a plan to vote now on a measure to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature law. But that is unlikely to pass, because it could leave millions without insurance and is likely push insurance markets into turmoil.
