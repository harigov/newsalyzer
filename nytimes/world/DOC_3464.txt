Gov. George Ryan of Illinois today paid the first visit to Cuba by a United States governor since the revolution of Fidel Castro in 1959, declaring that he had ''come here to build bridges between people.''Cuba welcomed the visit as a sign of eroding support in the United States for the embargo. In a sign of the importance Cuba attached to the visit, Mr. Ryan -- a Republican who is an opponent of the embargo -- was met at the international airport in Havana by Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly.Mr. Ryan was leading a 45-member delegation of state, business, religious and university leaders on a five-day visit. He planned to present more than $1 million worth of donated relief supplies.The trip was in line with a Clinton Administration policy, unveiled earlier this year, of encouraging direct contacts between the United States and the Cuban people. Mr. Ryan's ambitious agenda started with a private meeting and dinner with Mr. Alarcon.The Governor's schedule includes a Mass on Sunday at Havana's cathedral; meetings with high-ranking Cuban officials and dissidents; visits to medical centers, schools, farms, churches and museums, and a speech at the University of Havana. It is not known if the Governor will meet with Mr. Castro.
