SEOUL, South Korea —Mayor Oh Se-hoon of Seoul said on Friday that he was resigning after the failure of his campaign to end free lunches for all 810,000 elementary and middle school students.Seoul held a referendum on Wednesday, but low voter turnout invalidated it. That left in place the City Council’s program of providing the lunches for free, regardless of family income.It was a victory for the liberal opposition, which dominated the City Council and had urged people to boycott the referendum.“I decided to take responsibility by quitting immediately,” Mr. Oh told a news conference on Friday. He had earlier said that he would resign if he lost the referendum or if the turnout was not high enough.During his campaign against universal free lunches, he called for more restrained welfare spending.“An excessive welfare program will invariably bring about tax increases and impose a heavy burden on the future generations,” he said on Friday. “I hope that my resignation will help develop a more heated and thoughtful debate on excessive welfare.”A special election will be held on Oct. 26 to choose Mr. Oh’s replacement. He was elected to a second four-year term in June 2010.A race for mayor in Seoul, home to one-fifth of South Korea’s population of 50 million, is one of the country’s most contested political battles. One opposition leader has already declared his intention to run.With income inequity widening, welfare for the first time has become a major political issue in South Korea.
