(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump confronted Vladimir Putin over Russian meddling in the 2016 election during a longer-than-expected sit-down session at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg.Mr. Putin denied any interference, and asked for evidence. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, told reporters after the two leaders met that the disagreement might be “intractable,” but that the countries should try to “move forward.”Much of the meeting, which lasted over two hours, focused on Syria. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin reached an agreement on a limited cease-fire in the country’s southwest._____2. Protesters outside of the Group of 20 meeting clashed with the police, who used water cannons to stop them from advancing. The demonstrators were venting their anger over the global political and economic system.The G-20 meeting, comprising 19 countries and the European Union, was a fitting target. Its members are major economies who collectively produce 80 percent of the global gross domestic product.

Add Maxine Waters to the list of older public figures being embraced by millennials.The 78-year-old Democrat, who was first elected to represent a section of Los Angeles in Congress in 1990, has become a viral sensation thanks to her outspoken criticism of the White House. She hopes that her new fans will be inspired to enter the fray.“I was at the BET Awards with Chance the Rapper. And all these people get up and scream and holler,” Ms. Waters said. “I keep wondering, ‘Where did all these people come from? Why can’t they come into politics?’”_____4. The U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate ticked up because more people entered the work force. Wages still aren’t rising, though.Our senior economics correspondent says the numbers support optimism that the labor market has room to improve — with higher wages — before it gets worse.Economists are also waiting for the Trump administration to decide whether to impose tariffs on steel imports, a move that could provoke a global trade war._____5. Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited the American prison at Guantánamo Bay, in a gesture of support for the continuing detention of terrorism suspects there.The Trump administration has yet to bring any newly captured prisoners to the Cuban base, where 41 men are still being held.Earlier this year, officials circulated drafts of an executive order that would keep the prison open, but President Trump hasn’t signed it._____6. With each North Korean nuclear or missile test, United States officials protest and threaten, to no avail.The danger is severe and American leverage is limited, and there’s little way around that reality, our Interpreter columnist writes. Above, a photo released by North Korea of Kim Jong-un celebrating the latest missile test.The Interpreter, which focuses on international affairs, has its own newsletter. Sign up here._____7. For much of the world, cholera, a bacterial infection spread by water contaminated with feces, has been relegated to the history books.Yet this entirely preventable and treatable disease is ravaging war-torn Yemen. Malnourished children are particularly at risk, and the conflict there has badly damaged infrastructure and hospitals.Our reporter in Yemen spoke to many families who have lost children or other relatives. “The international community should just make people stop fighting and help our hospitals,” said one man who was nearly killed by the disease._____8. Chaunté Lowe learned eight years after the 2008 Olympics in Beijing that she had earned a bronze medal in the high jump.The reason? Three athletes — two Russians and a Ukrainian — who finished ahead of her failed retroactive doping tests, bumping her up from sixth place to third.It was her first medal, and she watched someone else receive it on the Olympic podium. As our sportswriter puts it, justice arrives like a distant echo. Above, Ms. Lowe in a competition last year._____9. Why are Jane Austen’s novels still so popular? We did some data analysis to answer that question.We mapped the vocabulary used in English novels published between 1710 and 1920, and discovered that Austen’s focused more on the abstract over the physical, and the quotidian over the melodramatic.Her word choices may help explain her enduring appeal._____10. Finally, Spider-Man is back on the big screen.Our critic says “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” is amusing and likable. Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker, but Michael Keaton owns the movie as the Vulture, “the regulation baddie, who after weaponizing some extraterrestrial leftovers has become a criminal mastermind, with the usual yelling, minions and death.”Have a great weekend._____Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
