LJUBLJANA, Slovenia —  After weeks of warnings about the dangers involved in Europe’s migrant influx, and fears about winter’s arrival, the worries of public officials and humanitarian groups were realized on Monday when thousands of asylum seekers, many of them families with small children, began to back up at crossings and were stranded in a chilly rain.The backups came just two days after Hungary closed its border with Croatia, and occurred as countries on the north end of the Balkan route tightened border controls while states to its south quarreled over how to manage the unabated human flow into Europe.The logjam followed a month of relative stability across the Balkans and Central Europe, as countries unofficially worked together to create a safe and relatively quick route north and west by transporting asylum seekers by bus or train from one border to the next, where they could exit on their way toward Germany, Sweden and other desired destinations.The arrangement filled the void left by the European Union, which has talked, bickered and failed to come up with a common solution to the problem of accommodating hundreds of thousands of new arrivals, many fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, or repression in places like Eritrea in northern Africa.A recent effort to stem the flow of migrants by keeping them in Turkey, and preventing them from entering the European Union through Greece, faltered over the weekend, when little progress was reported in talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Turkish leaders.No other plans appear to be on the table, and the safety of the migrants has depended upon the cooperation of the countries along the route, many of them dubious about the migration from the start and resentful that Germany has encouraged it by agreeing to accommodate asylum seekers.That policy by the government of Ms. Merkel has created tensions in Germany, as well, where the weekend stabbing of the politician in charge of refugee affairs in Cologne heightened the polemics surrounding the influx.On Monday evening, several thousand supporters of the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim movement Pegida gathered in Dresden to mark the one-year anniversary of their first rally. Thousands more turned out to protest what they say is the far right and even neo-Nazi tendency of Pegida, whose supporters often insist they are not right-wing extremists but only fighting for the West and their own identity.More than 1,000 police succeeded in keeping the two crowds apart as they hurled slogans and the occasional firecracker at each other. The police gave no crowd estimates but #durchgezaehlt, a hashtag giving estimates by Dresden students, estimated that there were about 20,000 Pegida supporters and around 14,000 opponents.Migrants officials had warned that one nation’s decision to close its borders could cause the Balkans migration to unravel. That happened late Friday, when Hungary closed the border with Croatia, cutting off a key route to Austria, about a month after Hungary closed its border with Serbia.But the migrants have been nothing if not resourceful and, with the cooperation of migration officials and national leaders, embraced a new path over the weekend, from Serbia to Croatia and then to Slovenia and Austria.Slovenia, a small Alpine country, became a new gateway to Europe and welcomed the migrants as long as they had no plans to stay. But officials warned that it could only accommodate so many within its borders. If Austria slowed its acceptance of migrants, leaders warned, there could be a backup. On Sunday night, after a smooth weekend, that is what happened.At least 1,000 migrants spent the night out in the buffer zone between Croatia and Slovenia, after Slovenia refused to take in a trainload of 1,800 migrants that Croatian authorities brought to its border at Trnovec early Monday.For hours, migrants waited outdoors in the rain. Some tried to sneak into Slovenia, prompting the Slovenian police to limit their movement behind a metal fence. Some tried to turn back to Croatia, but were prevented from reaching a shelter by the Croatian police.Near the Gruskovje border crossing between the two European Union member states, between two small towns, Slovenian police officers found about 300 people wandering around the fields and side roads early Monday. The migrants said they had been brought there in buses from Croatia and told to walk into Slovenia.Those border incidents have caused a diplomatic spat between Slovenia and Croatia, with the Slovenian interior minister accusing Croatian authorities of violating an agreement. Slovenia insisted that it was unable to receive and properly care for more than 2,500 people, while Croatia, facing a surge of migrants at its border with Serbia, demanded that Slovenia double that number.But Austria, where almost all of the migrants are headed, has set a daily quota of 1,500 people. Its border with Slovenia is in a mountainous area, and the movement of people to Austria’s heartland is slow, leaving the refugee centers on its side of the border vulnerable to overcrowding.Slovenia refused to accept more migrants until it could empty its registration and housing centers into Austria. In response, Croatia cut communication with authorities in Ljubljana, and brought more than 2,000 people overnight and early Monday morning to the Slovenian border, leaving them to find their own way forward.“Croatia’s conduct is unacceptable,” said Interior Minister Vesna Gyorkos Znidar of Slovenia. She said Slovenia could not take more people because it has limited capabilities to house and properly care for groups as large as 10,000 for a prolonged time, “since we know that they will not be able to continue their journey” to Austria.A senior Interior Ministry official, Bostjan Sefic, said Monday that there were about 5,000 people in the country, mostly Syrians, but also from Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. They have been registered, processed and transported to the country’s 12 reception centers, including the largest, in Spielfeld at the Austrian border, where as many as 2,000 were expected to spend the night.With reception centers at the Croatian borders with Serbia and Slovenia overcrowded and hundreds more migrants fighting each other while trying to get in from Serbia on Monday, Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic of Croatia tried to stem growing fears in the Mediterranean country of four million that thousands of migrants would be trapped there.“On the contrary, people will move on,” Mr. Milanovic said. .And they did late Monday. The United Nations refugee agency said that 2,000 to 3,000 migrants who had been stuck in Berkasovo, Serbia, at the border with Croatia, suddenly dispersed in the afternoon, without ceremony or warning.But within hours, the neat lines that had formed at the border’s reopening turned into large, disorganized crowds again. Cold, frustrated and soggy, many of the migrants shouted as they surged forward along a path of ankledeep mud strewn with discarded blankets, clothing and trash.“We are prepared for everything, and expect nothing,” said Melita Sunjic, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency in Serbia. “In this particular crisis, we cannot control the flow. The flow is controlled by political decisions to which we are not privy.”Officials had been hoping that the migrants’ trail would thin with the arrival of cold temperatures, as it has in years past. But so far there are few signs of that.Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said the flow of people from Turkey into Greece had actually increased, with 20,000 arriving over the weekend. On average, 5,000 to 6,000 migrants a day move from Greece to Macedonia, he said, then to Serbia and Croatia.In Germany, which has seen more than 300 violent episodes against migrants or their housing this year, officials cautioned that the anti-immigrant rhetoric must stop.“Stay away from those who are injecting this hatred, this poison into our country,” Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere warned about Pegida on national television Sunday. “The people who organize this are hard-line, right-wing extremists.”Henriette Reker, 58, won Sunday’s mayoral election in Cologne a day after she was stabbed several times in the neck by a man said by the police to have links to right wingers. Ms. Reker is expected to make a full recovery, but the attack shocked a country already reeling from the refugee influx.“Pegida is sowing the hatred, which then turns into violence,” Justice Minister Heiko Maas said Monday.
