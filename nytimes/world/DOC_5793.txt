CAIRO —  Representatives of Libya’s dueling parliaments signed a United Nations-brokered agreement on Thursday to form a national unity government that supporters said was an important and long overdue step toward ending years of chaos and civil war.Negotiations over the agreement, which was signed in Skhirat, Morocco, had been underway for more than a year. It was finalized after intense diplomacy by Western nations, including the United States, that was widely seen as motivated by concerns about the growing strength of a Libyan branch of the Islamic State.The agreement was signed by deputies representing the rival parliaments. More than 200 other Libyans, including elected lawmakers and local officials, attended the signing ceremony, according to Naima Jibril, a Libyan judge who attended.Judge Jibril called it a “historic day” and said the deal had the support of ordinary Libyans who were not often heard from, rather than “people with militias, or special interests.”But analysts and critics of the deal said the Western pressure might have also resulted in an agreement that was rushed and did not yet have broad enough support from powerful factions across the fractured North African country, including figures who are trying to forge a competing pact. Important questions about how the agreement will be carried out remain unanswered, including where the new government will be based, given the ongoing violence in Tripoli, the capital, and how Libya’s unregulated militias will be brought into line, they said.In a recent report warning of the risks posed by the deal, the International Crisis Group said, “Granting recognition to a government that has insufficient backing will condemn it to irrelevance.”Libya has become deeply divided since the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi four years ago. Rival governments project a meager authority in the east and west of the country, undermined by their internal divisions and by unaccountable armed groups that hold sway on the ground. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence, and the birthplace of the revolt, the eastern city of Benghazi, has been decimated by war.The push to unify the country took on added urgency over the last year because of a collapsing economy and the rise of a branch of the Islamic State, which has taken control of the town of Surt and is increasingly regarded by counterterrorism officials as the most dangerous Islamic State affiliate.Claudia Gazzini, a Libya researcher with the International Crisis Group, said she understood the pressures on Libyans as well as Western powers to seat a unity government. European governments in particular accelerated their push after the terrorist attacks in Paris. “They fear the consolidation of the Islamic State in Libya, and wanted to see something quickly done,” she said.There is also talk, she said, of a European bombing campaign against the Islamic State militants in Libya — a move that would require the consent of a unified government.But, Ms. Gazzini added, “it is too risky to move forward without having a clear security plan in place, without having activated a dialogue between the various armed groups,” and without ensuring that the government can be safely based in Tripoli. It would have been better, she said, “to pause for a minute, and bring more people onboard.”Abdulrahman Swehli, an influential figure in Misurata who has opposed the unity agreement, said some named to initially head the government were “weak,” given the size of the challenges facing any new government in Libya.“They have no experience running anything before,” he said. “I can’t figure out how these figures can run Libya in the next difficult phase.”
