During the dark winter months in the Arctic Ocean, zooplankton migrate by the light of the moon, a new study reports.During warmer months, the tiny marine animals descend from the water’s surface when the sun rises to escape predators. At night, they typically rise again to feed.During the dark winters, however, zooplankton follow the lunar cycle. “Every time the moon is full and high in the sky, there’s a large migration from the surface to a depth of about 50 to 60 meters,” said Kim S. Last, a marine biologist at the Scottish Association for Marine Science and one of the study’s authors.She and her colleagues sampled the water column all over the Arctic. They were surprised to find that this vertical migration occurred throughout the ocean — in fjords, shelves, slopes and in open sea.“Everywhere, this happens for six days each month when the moon is above the horizon,” Dr. Last said.The findings, which appear in the journal Current Biology, are significant because zooplankton are abundant and found in all oceans. Fish, whales and other animals depend on them as a food source.“In terms of biomass and volume, theirs is the biggest daily migration on the planet,” Dr. Last said. “Except for maybe people, since we migrate as well.”
