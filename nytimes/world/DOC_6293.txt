LONDON — Syngenta said on Tuesday that its takeover by the state-owned China National Chemical Corporation could be delayed until early 2017, as European authorities take a deeper look at a wave of deals among the biggest producers of seeds and chemicals designed to protect crops.European Union antitrust regulators briefly suspended, in September, their review of a proposed deal between Dow Chemical and DuPont after the companies failed to supply requested information. Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s commissioner in charge of competition policy, has also vowed to closely review Bayer’s $56 billion proposal to take over Monsanto.Syngenta, a giant in farm chemicals and seeds, said on Tuesday that European officials and others had requested “a large amount of additional information,” and that the final approval of its acquisition by China National Chemical, known as ChemChina, would probably be extended into the first quarter of next year. It did not say which other regulators had requested more details.The companies had originally hoped to complete the $43 billion deal by the end of this year.“ChemChina and Syngenta remain fully committed to the transaction and are confident of its closure,” Erik Fyrwald, the Syngenta chief executive, said in a news release.Syngenta’s shares declined sharply on Monday after news reports that ChemChina had not submitted any potential concessions to European regulators before a deadline last week to potentially win early approval of the transaction.Shares of Syngenta rose 1.8 percent in early trading on Tuesday in Switzerland, where the company is based.In August, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States signed off on the merger, removing one of the biggest potential impediments, as the interagency body had previously been an obstacle to cross-border agreements involving Chinese companies.ChemChina agreed to acquire Syngenta in February, about six months after Syngenta had rejected a $47 billion bid by Monsanto. Syngenta said at the time that the American company’s offer undervalued it and that the deal might be difficult to finalize because of regulatory concerns.Monsanto abandoned its pursuit and agreed to be acquired by Bayer of Germany last month.Syngenta, based in Basel, is one of the world’s largest suppliers of agricultural products, including insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and seeds. It was formed in November 2000 by the merger of the agriculture subsidiaries of the drug makers Novartis and AstraZeneca.The Syngenta deal is one of a series of transactions by the Chinese company recently.In January, it took a minority stake in Mercuria, a Swiss energy and commodities company, to diversify its portfolio and expand into the energy sector. That same month, it sealed a deal for KraussMaffei, a German manufacturer of plastic- and rubber-processing machinery. And last year, ChemChina bought Pirelli, an Italian tire maker.
