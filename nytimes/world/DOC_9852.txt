Mixing and matching corals of the same species from different latitudes could help coral reefs survive despite warming ocean temperatures, according to a new study.“Corals already have the genetic variance to adapt to changing temperature,” said Mikhail Matz, an assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin. “It’s just a matter of transporting these mutations from hot locations to locations that will be hot very soon because of global warming.”Dr. Matz and his colleagues studied corals from naturally warmer areas of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and those in cooler water 300 miles to the south. The researchers found that coral larvae with parents from the north, where waters are slightly warmer, were up to 10 times as likely to survive elevated temperatures in laboratory studies.They reported their findings in the journal Science.Dr. Matz and his colleagues also found that when the coral from the north and south were crossbred, genes for heat tolerance could be passed on. “Not only is heat tolerance heritable, but it’s highly heritable,” he said.Coral larvae move across waters naturally, and crossbreeding will occur anyway. Dr. Matz said humans could speed the process up by 10 to 20 years.He warned, though, that as the climate continues to warm, coral reefs still face threats. “This is not a magic bullet,” Dr. Matz said. “The existence of this gene variation buys us some time.”
