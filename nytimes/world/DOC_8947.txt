The first American satellite designed to explore the planet Jupiter and then to shoot out of the solar system, perhaps to discover other worlds, has reached the vicinity of the planet.The spacecraft, Pioneer 10, has moved within the orbits of Jupiter's moons and now faces a major test: an encounter with the intense radiation that encircles the planet. Some experts fear that the spacecraft, which is expected to provide information on Jupiter's atmosphere and radiation belt, may be silenced as it, passes through the belt on Dec. 3 and moves to within 81,000 miles of the planet. Should the vehicle be destroyed, a sister ship, Pioneer 11, due to arrive a year later, will be steered clear of the belt. On Dec. 3 Pioneer 10 will be half a billion miles from earth in its eternal journey, so far 21 month old.If all goes well, Pioneer 10 will be the first spacecraft to leave the solar system. It carries with it a plaque to inform residents of another world that we are here.
