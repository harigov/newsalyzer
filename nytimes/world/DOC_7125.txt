What’s for Dinner? answers that universal question, offering recipes for simple, relatively quick dishes that use ingredients you can pick up on the way home.Sautéing onions and garlic is the first step on the road to so many dinners at my house that I often start heating up the skillet even before I decide what else should go in it.While my alliums slowly turn golden, I consider my options. For the simplest meals, I’ll add vegetables, protein (meat, fish, tofu, cooked beans), a squeeze of lemon and some torn fresh herbs and call it a night.But here, I’ve gone for something more complex, augmenting the flavors but keeping the same basic technique.This Thai-inspired red curry starts out with the requisite alliums (if you have shallots, use them; they will make this slightly sweeter than using a regular onion). To this I add ginger, fresh chile and minced cilantro stems for brightness, heat and funk, respectively. You could throw in any vegetables and protein and a squeeze of lime juice at the end and stop there. But a little red curry paste from a jar and coconut milk from a can turn a quick and simple meal into something wonderfully luscious, fiery and fragrant without much added effort.You can vary the vegetables and switch up the protein. The creamy sauce works well with pretty much whatever you fold into it. Serve it over rice to catch every drop.Recipe: Coconut Red Curry With Tofu
