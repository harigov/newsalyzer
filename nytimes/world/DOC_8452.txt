President Obama will meet with leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.The influence of the council, whose members are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has grown across the Middle East since the Arab Spring, and these countries have tried to counter what they view as an increasingly assertive Iran.Here are some of the issues likely to be on the agenda when Mr. Obama and the gulf leaders sit down together.The gulf monarchies have been concerned that the nuclear deal struck last year has empowered Iran, their main regional rival, and has frayed their relations with the Obama administration. Iran’s recent missile tests have further infuriated the gulf states. The United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, recently said that Iran remained “as dangerous as ever.”The United States has looked to reassure the council members with plans for a new missile defense infrastructure and cyberdefenses. Persuading gulf states to support the Iran nuclear deal is unlikely, but the Obama administration still hopes it can minimize their complaints about it.The United States relies heavily on council members, particularly Saudi Arabia, to provide money and arms to Western-backed rebel groups fighting the Syrian government and Islamic State extremists.The gulf states want to increase international pressure on Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, to maintain a partial cease-fire that appears increasingly fragile and commit seriously to the current round of diplomatic talks in Geneva.The Obama administration has quietly supported the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, providing intelligence, airborne fuel tankers and munitions.The United States’ Arab allies have at times complained that the American support is insufficient, and comes with too many restrictions.The mounting civilian death toll in Yemen has led to international criticism of how the Saudi-led coalition is carrying out its military operations as well as questions over American support for what critics call a reckless war.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been part of the international campaign against Islamic State extremists since the summer of 2014, but their participation fell off as they became more deeply involved in the conflict in Yemen.As the United States steps up its military campaign after battlefield successes by Western-backed forces in Iraq and Syria, one point of discussion may be how the gulf states can help thwart the expansion of the Islamic State in Europe, Libya and Afghanistan.Mr. Obama will most likely push the council members to bolster their defense spending and take on even bigger military roles in the region so the United States does not have to. He also may have to address his recent description of America’s gulf allies — and some Europeans — as “free riders.”The sharp drop in the price of oil has hurt the gulf states’ economies, leading to  budget deficits and cuts in public spending in Saudi Arabia.With young populations — a recent study found that more than half of Saudi Arabia’s population is under 25 — the gulf states will need to create millions of jobs in the coming years.Looking beyond the success of the United Arab Emirates in becoming a financial and transportation hub, Mr. Obama may want to hear about plans to diversify the regional economy.It is not among the topics that the gulf monarchies are eager to discuss, but Mr. Obama might question how the Sunni-dominated countries are treating their Shiite populations, and raise the issue of equal rights for women.
