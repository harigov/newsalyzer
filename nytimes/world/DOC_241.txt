(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Welcome back, Congress.The nation’s lawmakers have returned from the July 4 holiday, and the clock is ticking on the health care bill. The bill is attached to a 2017 budget, and the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Going beyond that date would complicate matters. Above, a protest over the weekend in Kentucky.We found a rare bit of collaboration in this legislative session: the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees. They’re moving forward with an ambitious, largely bipartisan agenda to improve care for the nation’s 21 million vets._____2. Let us catch you up on the latest on Russia’s contacts with the Trump campaign.Five White House advisers told our reporters that President Trump’s eldest son was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer last year. Readers have added more than 3,300 comments to the story.Donald Trump Jr. gave two different explanations for the meeting.It turns out that the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow offered the Trump family links to Russia — and to the Kremlin. Above, the after-party._____ 3. The nation’s consumer watchdog adopted a new rule that would mean that banks and credit card companies could no longer force customers into arbitration, restoring their ability to band together in class-action suits. It could take effect next year.The change would deal a serious blow to Wall Street and could wind up costing those firms billions.It is almost certain to set off a political firestorm in Washington, where both the Trump administration and House Republicans have pushed to rein in the agency, called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Above, its director, Richard Cordray._____4. Now that Mosul has been largely retaken from the militants of the Islamic State, uncertainty about the city’s future is emerging.Our correspondent says the end of the fighting “resurfaces a vital question that has been asked ever since the modern and multisectarian state of Iraq was created from the ashes of World War I: Can the country hold together?”And representatives of Syria’s warring factions met in Geneva for a seventh round of peace talks, as a limited truce appeared to be holding in the country’s southwest._____5. Wildfires rolled across dry terrain in the Western United States and Canada, fueled by lightning, strong winds and temperatures in the triple digits.The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for regions in at least six states, signaling critical conditions over the next 24 hours. In some areas, firefighters have been battling fires for a week. Above, a scene from Oroville, Calif._____6. In New York, the first day of “the summer of hell” wasn’t so bad.Two months of track closings at Penn Station have now begun. Three derailments this year highlighted the urgency of repairs.Penn is the nation’s busiest train station, and tracks used by New Jersey Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak are affected, along with thousands of travelers. See our commuting guide.We also published some unexpectedly beautiful images of Penn Station, including the one above, by the photographer Zach Gross._____7. The body of Christ cannot be gluten-free.That’s the word from the Vatican. Communion wafers and other unleavened bread cannot be made from rice, potato or other wheat substitutes that are completely free of the protein. But products that use so little wheat starch that they can be legally labeled “gluten-free” are fine.The Anglican Communion has a similar position, while some other Christian denominations do allow truly gluten-free bread._____8. Stuffed monkeys, ivory carvings, snow leopard coats and dried seal penises.Those are just some of the items confiscated at American airports and sent to the National Wildlife Property Repository, near Denver. (It also accepts donated items.)We sent a photographer to take a look. The images he came back with are a testament, if you will, to the human appetite for other species._____9. Tonight is Major League Baseball’s annual Home Run Derby at Marlins Park in Miami, above. Our sportswriter says it may seem redundant, because it basically describes the entire first half of the season.Baseball is on pace for 6,117 home runs this season, which shatters the previous record. June had the most of any month ever.Analytics and tech have persuaded players to swing higher. But some fans worry about the trade-off of homers versus action in the field._____ 10. Finally, got a full house? We put together some tips on how to cook for a crowd. Above center, Cheryl Flake, who is married to Senator Jeff Flake and was one of the experts we consulted.Elsewhere in our robust advice department: Our Smarter Living newsletter covers how to get stuff done ( stop looking at Instagram), and our Well section has ideas on how to raise a bilingual child (start early).
