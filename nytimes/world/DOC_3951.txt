MOSCOW —  Electricity was finally restored to Crimea on Tuesday, two weeks after unknown saboteurs blew up high-tension power lines in Ukraine, plunging millions on the peninsula into darkness.Ukrainian linemen connected one of the four power lines on Tuesday morning, after the Crimean Tatar protesters who had blocked utility crews finally relented — so that power could be provided to critically important facilities, such as hospitals and schools, they said.But that line, together with local sources and the expedited connection of the first phase of direct, undersea links with the Russian power grid last week, was enough to restore normal power supply on the peninsula, Russia’s Energy Ministry said.Trolley buses began to run in Simferopol and the local government promised to turn on streetlights by the end of the week.The Ukrainian nationalist group Right Sector, which had also blocked repair crews from the site, said in a statement that it did not approve of the decision to restore power.“We interpret it as another anti-Ukrainian step by the current regime,” the statement said, referring to the government in Kiev. “Some of our allies and partners flirt with our enemies.”The Tatars had demanded that Russia release political prisoners and allow more international oversight of human rights issues in Crimea, but those demands were not fulfilled.The Ukrainian government had been coy about the blockade, neither openly endorsing it nor dispersing the activists in order to repair the power lines.At the end of November, however, Russia and the pro-Russian separatists who control mines in eastern Ukraine began to restrict coal supplies to Ukraine, an embargo that analysts say had some effect on Kiev’s thinking.“It was clear that Russia would not make any concessions and that Ukraine would instead face difficulties with coal supplies,” Valentin Zemlyansky, an energy expert at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said in a phone interview. “It is also not a coincidence that it happened just a few days after Russia launched its own power supply to the peninsula.”Ukraine still claims the peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in March 2014.
