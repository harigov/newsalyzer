NEWMARKET, England — It is called the sport of kings and it has been in this haven of racecourses, stables and studs since the 17th century, when King Charles I and his courtiers made the 100-mile journey here by horse-drawn carriages.But the town has never known a darker passage than the past week. Another monarch, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai, and Godolphin, his global horse racing enterprise, have been the talk of Britain after what The Times of London described as British racing’s “Lance Armstrong moment.”On Monday, the British Horseracing Authority announced that 11 of the sheik’s best horses tested positive for banned anabolic steroids, including stanozolol and ethylestrenol, which can give horses a muscle strength that is well beyond their natural capacity. Forty-five Godolphin horses were tested in an out-of-competition sweep earlier this month at the Moulton Paddocks stables.Godolphin, which has a billion-dollar roster of 5,000 racehorses stabled in 12 countries, including the United States and Japan, quickly announced that its own tests found four more of its Newmarket-based horses had banned steroids in their systems.Although the drugs are strictly barred in Britain during training and competition, several other countries, including Australia, Dubai and the United States, allow their use in training, as long as they are not present in a horse’s system on the day of a race.Godolphin announced an immediate lockdown of Moulton Paddocks, with no further competition for its 100 horses until all have cleared drugs tests and the stable is judged to be completely clean. The 15 horses that tested positive for steroids were barred from racing for six months.At a hastily convened meeting Thursday, the racing authority imposed an eight-year ban from racing activities on Maktoum’s favorite young trainer, Mahmood al-Zarooni, and left to discussion between Godolphin and the racing authority what penalties will be served by a foreman and two grooms on the sheik’s Newmarket payroll.Horse racing experts in Britain have called it as the worst scandal in the country’s horse racing history and worry that it has the power to severely damage Godolphin.The episode has been a severe embarrassment to Maktoum, who has taken a leading role in international demands for clean racing. One of his wives, the 38-year-old Oxford-educated Princess Haya of Jordan, was elected president of the International Equestrian Federation in 2006 on a clean sport mandate.Although the sheik was quick to condemn the doping, saying he was “appalled and angered,” there are concerns about how he may react in the longer term to the blow to his prestige.Maktoum, 63, also the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, single-handedly bankrolls a large chunk of horse racing in Britain. He has been one of the few foreign dignitaries invited to join Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, in the ceremonial carriage ride that delivers the British monarch to the royal enclosure at the Royal Ascot meeting every summer that crowns the British racing season. The queen has spoken admiringly of the sheik, and lauded him as an important friend of Britain’s.Under criticism from some in the Middle East for spending such large sums on a personal pastime, the sheik, who is said to have a fortune of $10 billion, has responded by saying that Godolphin’s successes give an immense boost to Dubai’s reputation. Maktoum made the link between the success and prestige of Godolphin and the reputation of Dubai explicit in his statement on the scandal, presenting it, in effect, as a matter of his and Dubai’s honor.“I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules,” he said. “I built my country based on the same solid principles.”The racing authority’s hearing Thursday found that Zarooni brought the banned drugs into Britain from Dubai. After saying initially that he had not known that the steroids were banned during training in Britain, Zarooni changed his account before the hearing, taking sole responsibility for the doping, describing it as a “catastrophic error” and apologizing abjectly to the sheik and the British racing community.In 2010, Maktoum appointed Zarooni, a former groom in Dubai, to head Moulton Paddocks, effectively making him a rival to Saeed bin Suroor, the trainer who helped build Godolphin into the dominant force in Britain by winning more than 200 first-class races. For the past three years, the two men have worked from separate Newmarket yards.Zarooni has had some major successes in British racing and overseas, including training Monterosso, who won the 2012 Dubai World Cup. But his performance had come into question by Suroor’s supporters. Zarooni also had a fractious relationship with Godolphin’s top jockey, Frankie Dettori, who is said to have objected to training practices that he considered too harsh and has left the stable. Two of Zarooni’s horses tested positive for banned substances in competition in August, triggering the out-of-competition testing this month at Moulton Paddocks.Racing officials said investigations would continue into how medications at the yard were controlled, and into who else, including the veterinary staff, may have known what was going on. But they appeared keen to exculpate Maktoum personally, yielding to his request that the hearing be held quickly after the doping was announced, and accepting Zarooni’s confession after four hours of testimony.If the haste reflected a wider concern in the industry to ease the pressure on Maktoum, a statement after the hearing by Simon Crisford, Godolphin’s racing manager, alluded to the concern that the Dubai ruler might be so upset by the scandal that he would contemplate closing down or cutting back his operations in Britain. The Aga Khan, once about as dominant in British racing as Maktoum, did just that after a doping scandal in the 1990s.In Newmarket, the scandal struck with the force of a meteorite. The sheik’s two extravagantly appointed stables are to Newmarket what Apple is to Cupertino, Calif., or NASA is to Cape Canaveral, Fla. — the town’s biggest employer, the linchpin of its prestige, and the guarantor of its civic well-being.The town boasts that it is the racing headquarters of the world. Out on the gallops where hundreds of racehorses train from first light every day, in the stables, and in the pubs with walls cluttered with photographs and portraits of Newmarket-trained horses, the talk this week has been about little else than the disaster that has befallen Godolphin and the toll it could take on the town.Much of the banter, at least with outsiders, takes the form of gallows humor. One Godolphin foreman appeared for Friday’s gallops not long after dawn wearing a blue Godolphin windbreaker and with a length of twisted rope around his neck to be used, he said, as a tether for any horse threatening to throw its rider.Soaked by a persistent drizzle as he waited at the bottom of Warren Hill, a 1,000-yard stretch of lush grass and muddy walkways that has been used for training horses for centuries, the foreman, who gave his name as Tom and said he had been in the racing business for 40 years, said he had heard from riders of other yards in recent days every joke there was to be made about the “noose” and its appropriateness for Godolphin’s plight.“Don’t worry,” he added, “we’ll get through this, I guarantee you that.”
