PARIS — “Free trade” have become dirty words in the United States and much of Europe, seen as the source of a host of ills traced to the globalized marketplace, from the loss of manufacturing jobs to the rise of immigration to the threat of dubious food imports.Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican Party nominee for president, gives these themes their most virulent spin when he accuses China of “raping” the United States, or threatens to build a wall on the Mexican border. In the Democratic Party, Bernie Sanders has pilloried Hillary Clinton for her support of past trade treaties.In Europe, particularly in Germany and France, the campaign against a proposed free trade treaty between the United States and the European Union has taken to the streets, as protesters raise the specter of American chlorine-washed chicken, and hormone-fed beef invading their supermarkets.Yet most experts agree that free trade is not entirely to blame for the dislocations and anxieties now so prevalent in the developed world. Nor, they say, should the remedy be a rejection of globalization, but rather a concerted international effort to address deeper and broader economic changes that many people see as unfair.The long, and jumbled, list of charges against free trade — broadly defined — comes at a time when many citizens feel that their interests have been sacrificed to global corporate profits.In a speech in Frankfurt on April 5, Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, addressed the growing perception that “the cards are stacked against the common man — or woman — in favor of elites.”These frustrations, she said, have led to a questioning of “established institutions and international norms,” leading some to say, “Well, why don’t we look inward? Why don’t we hide behind our borders?” Such a retreat to protectionism, she warned, would be a “tragic course,” as history has proved time and again.Yet the facts of growing inequality are undisputed, even as experts debate whether global competition is to blame.Ms. Lagarde cited a shocking statistic from a January report by Oxfam, the anti-poverty organization: The world’s 62 richest people now own the same wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion.Other studies show that in industrialized societies, low-wage workers have been losing not only jobs, particularly in factories, but also their share of the national income, in stark contrast to the very rich — often their former bosses.In a 2012 report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that incomes for the top 1 percent of earners in advanced economies had increased 20 percent in the last two decades, while low-wage workers have seen incomes fall. In the United States, the average pay plus bonuses for a chief executive officer of the top 350 companies in the United States was $16.3 million in 2014, up 54.3 percent since 2009.As the Oxfam report concluded, “Far from trickling down, income and wealth are instead being sucked upwards at an alarming rate.”There is a large caveat to this conclusion, often overlooked in the political debate in Europe and the United States. Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty fell from 36 percent to 16 percent.The decline in inequality between nations is largely due to global trade, which has fueled economic growth in China, Southeast Asia and India in particular. But inside those countries, the gap between rich and poor has grown, chipping away at gains by low-wage workers.Now, experts are warning that a slowdown in global trade, propelled by dropping commodity prices, could slow the convergence between rich and poor countries.In most advanced economies, experts agree that free trade plays a minor role in the widening gap between labor and capital. The real culprits are broader, deeper changes in the labor market in industrialized countries, mostly linked to technology, which have left unskilled workers unable to compete.In the United States, for instance, the impact of competition from China is the most significant, accounting for one-fifth of the loss of six million factory jobs between 1999 and 2010, whereas the loss of jobs to Mexico, following the 1995 North American Free Trade Agreement or Nafta, has had little statistical impact, given the small size of the Mexican economy.That does little to ease the pain in communities where laid-off workers have still not found work, undercutting arguments of economists who said back in the mid-1990s that free trade would eventually benefit everyone.The failure of low-wage workers in some regions to find new jobs has amplified the popular narrative against Nafta in particular, according to Robert Lawrence, a Harvard economist and expert in deindustrialization.“People find examples, and certain regions and cities have been affected,” he said, “but the bottom line is, Nafta is not a big deal.”In his view, the problem for America’s laid-off factory workers is not so much global competition, but a failure of government to address deeper, more systemic shifts in the labor market that have nothing to do with trade deficits. Rather, the explanations have to do with new technologies, including automation, which have led to greater labor productivity, cheaper prices and fewer manufacturing jobs. “What is stunning is that virtually every major industrial economy is witnessing the same trend,” Mr. Lawrence said. He cited the case of Germany, a manufacturing powerhouse with a healthy trade surplus, which has seen the share of factory jobs drop from 36.7 percent in 1973 to 21 percent in 2010.Addressing the irreversible trend — which Mr. Lawrence compares to the loss of agricultural jobs in the 1960s — would involve a series of measures that, for the most part, have been overlooked in the United States, including a more progressive tax system, better training for unskilled workers, changes to a system of higher education to give college students the skills they need, without crippling debt.In her Frankfurt speech, Ms. Lagarde made similar proposals, urging the United States to expand tax credits to lower-income workers, raise the minimum wage and offer more government assistance to families. In Europe, she said, governments should do more to give workers, especially the young, the skills they need.“Every country has something to do,” she said, running through a list of fiscal as well as structural changes needed to correct the inequality and disequilibrium in the global economy. “The answer to the reality of our interconnected world is not fragmentation. It is cooperation.”
