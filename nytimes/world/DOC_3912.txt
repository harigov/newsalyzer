WIMBLEDON, England — Facing more and more complaints about the condition of the famed Wimbledon grass under unusually hot conditions, the head groundskeeper of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club said Saturday that the courts would be fine through the end of the tournament next weekend.“Absolutely,” said the groundskeeper, Neil Stubley, who oversees the most important vegetation in tennis. “There’s not a doubt in our minds.”A string of hot, dry days in the first week of the tournament punished the grass, leaving dusty ruts around the most heavily trodden areas around the baselines, a common phenomenon at Wimbledon. But some lower-ranked players have been vocal in their complaints, saying the surface has caused them to slip.On Saturday, Novak Djokovic said that he had finally noticed it but that he did not think it was dangerous.“It was a bit softer,” he said.Some players who are used to these conditions on the last few days of Wimbledon prefer the grass because the footing can be more consistent. Roger Federer said the courts were the same as always, but he also said he was curious how the conditions would be addressed going forward. After Federer’s match on Saturday, Stubley’s crew watered Centre Court.Stubley said he and his crew constantly monitored the conditions and reacted accordingly, taking into consideration the weather forecast, which calls for rain later in the week.“We have the mechanisms in place that we can add water, we can dry them a little bit more,” he said. “We can actually be in control of how the plant is surviving.”
