Which news stories from decades past would you like to see re-examined today? Our weekly online video series, Retro Report, revisits what are supposedly old stories — but they all have much to tell us about news today.This fall we have re-examined stories including the thalidomide drug scandal that left babies around the world deformed; the not-so-happy tale of the killer whale star of “Free Willy” and the unsuccessful attempts to control wildfires that burned through Yellowstone National Park in 1988. Our next couple of videos will address the cloning of Dolly the sheep and lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina.Some of the most popular videos from last spring included a new look at Al Sharpton’s role in the Tawana Brawley scandal; the crack baby epidemic that wasn’t; and the Tailhook sexual harassment abuses from 20 years ago and why they continue to plague the military today.Now, we’d love to hear suggestions for stories from decades past that you’d like to see re-examined in future Retro Reports.
