HONG KONG — A vehicle license plate in Hong Kong sold at auction for 18.1 million Hong Kong dollars on Sunday, or $2.3 million, the highest price ever paid in the city. The plate carries the number 28, which in Cantonese sounds similar to a phrase for “easy money.”The new owner of the plate was not immediately clear. The bidder, who also snatched the license plate 232 for $174,000, said he was representing another party, whom he did not name, according to Oriental Daily News, a Hong Kong newspaper.The city introduced bidding for coveted license plate numbers in 1973, with the money going to charity. The most desired plates, which include the numbers 2 through 10 (1 is reserved for the police commissioner) and combinations of auspicious digits, are owned by some of the city’s richest and most prominent people.In 1994, the jewelry, property and entertainment tycoon Albert Yeung bought 9 for what was then a record of $1.6 million. The most recent peak license price was $2.1 million for 18, in 2008.Ten years ago, Hong Kong began to allow a wide array of vanity plates using letters of the alphabet, which triggered a rush of vehicular declarations like MCDADDY, XBATMANX and WHATEVER.Will 28 bring easy money? The answer is as uncertain as the identity of its new owner. But a 2009 study by Travis Ng, Terence Chong and Xin Du at the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that for three-digit license plates, including a lucky number such as 8 brought a price premium of 95 percent. The premium got bigger the worse the stock market did, jumping 11 percent for each 1 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.Likewise, unlucky numbers brought down the price. The presence of a number 4, which is a homonym for “death,” brings down the value of a four-digit plate 27 percent, and the price drops further with each fall in the Hang Seng.“A ‘4’ is bad, but it is even worse in bad times,” they wrote.
