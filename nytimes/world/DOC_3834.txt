Stephen Colbert will host this year’s Emmy Awards, CBS announced on Monday.This will be his first crack at hosting the show, and his selection means that late-night hosts will occupy slots for several major awards programs. Jimmy Fallon hosted the Golden Globes this month, the Grammys will be hosted by James Corden next month and Jimmy Kimmel, last year’s Emmys host, will take on the Oscars next month.The Emmys rotate among the four broadcast networks, and each usually picks a host from within its own ranks. Two years ago, Fox selected Andy Samberg, the star of its comedy “Brooklyn Nine-Nine;” four years ago, CBS chose Neil Patrick Harris, who was staring in its sitcom “How I Met Your Mother.”Mr. Corden, Mr. Colbert’s late-night counterpart at CBS, hosted last year’s Tonys, which had ratings highs. At last year’s Emmys, Mr. Colbert’s show was snubbed altogether in the best variety category while Mr. Corden’s “The Late Late Show” picked up a nomination. (The award went to John Oliver for his HBO show, “Last Week Tonight.”)Still, there are some signs that Mr. Colbert’s show is picking up steam, especially with the Trump administration in its earliest days. On Friday, the day of the inauguration, Mr. Colbert had his best ratings in over a year.The Emmys, which will be broadcast on Sept. 17, have had ratings problems; each of the last year two years it has had record lows in viewership. In a nod to comments by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Saturday about the size of the crowd at President Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Colbert said in a statement: “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period. Both in person and around the globe.”
