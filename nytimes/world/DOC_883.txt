To the Editor:Re “To-Do List for Uber Boss: Woo Drivers” (news analysis, Business Day, June 23):Uber’s decision to finally offer in-app tipping is long overdue and undoubtedly welcome by its drivers, but let’s be clear: It’s a move that passes the responsibility for decent pay onto Uber’s riders, not Uber itself.What allows Uber to get away with its poor treatment of workers is its business model, which depends on misclassifying drivers as “independent contractors,” carving them out of basic employment protections.Given Uber’s plans for a driverless future, conflict between Uber and its drivers may be unavoidable. That future is still a long way off, however, and Uber can’t shirk its responsibility to its drivers today because of a technology that is many years away.Small steps by the company to improve working conditions and pay for drivers are steps in the right direction, but they are merely a bandage on a much deeper problem of a culture that treats its drivers as disposable.REBECCA SMITH, SEATTLEThe writer is deputy director of the National Employment Law Project.
