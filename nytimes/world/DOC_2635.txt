The body of the former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos will remain for now in its refrigerated crypt in the northern Philippines, as it has for most of the two decades since he died in exile in Hawaii. President Benigno Aquino III — the son of former President Corazon Aquino, who ousted Mr. Marcos in a 1986 uprising — appeared to put an end to a public spat with Mr. Marcos’s son, who was demanding that the body be buried in the national cemetery in Manila along with other dignitaries. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Aquino said that a state funeral would be the “height of injustice” toward the victims of Mr. Marcos’s strongman rule. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who is now a senator, said he was offended by the surprise announcement, which appeared to ignore the recommendation of a presidential commission to bury Mr. Marcos with honors. “All these talks, discussions and debates turned out to be just a stage play,” Mr. Marcos said. The president replied, “I think I will have to communicate this to the vice president, I apologize, he’s been doing the study on my behalf.”
