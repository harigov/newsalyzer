BERGERAC, France — Marcel Kittel has no serious challenger for the King of the Sprint title at this year’s Tour de France.Kittel, of Germany, won the 10th stage with remarkable ease Tuesday, and Chris Froome of Britain stayed safely in the main pack to retain the yellow jersey as the overall race leader.Kittel perfectly timed his effort in the final straight for his fourth stage win, crossing the line ahead of his fellow German John Degenkolb.The stage took the peloton on a flat, 111-mile run from Perigueux to Bergerac in southwestern France.Froome, a three-time Tour champion, will wear the yellow jersey for the 50th time Wednesday — joining the five-time Tour winner Jacques Anquetil in fourth place on the career list behind Eddy Merckx (96), Bernard Hinault (75) and Miguel Indurain (60).“A huge, huge honor,” Froome said of reaching that mark.Kittel was in 10th place after negotiating the two sharp corners of a challenging final kilometer. He then accelerated and surged ahead of his rivals with 150 meters left to secure his 13th career win on the Tour.He won by a bike’s length and had plenty of time to raise his arms in celebration before crossing the line.Kittel said his confidence was high after a string of victories.“I know now from the last sprints that I can hold that speed to the finish line,” he said. “I almost cannot believe what’s happening here at the Tour.”The Dutch rider Dylan Groenewegen finished third.With Mark Cavendish, Peter Sagan and Arnaud Demare out of the race, Kittel strengthened his grip on the green jersey, given to the top sprinter. The French sprinter Nacer Bouhanni, who had to settle for a sixth-place finish, acknowledged Kittel’s superiority.“Kittel was the strongest, he came from behind,” Bouhanni said. “He won four sprints out of five, he is the best sprinter of this Tour.”Bouhanni was later fined 200 Swiss francs ($207) and given a one-minute penalty in the general classification for “assault,” the race jury said. The jury did not elaborate on what prompted the penalty.Video footage showed Bouhanni elbowing an unidentified rider from the Quick-Step Floors team toward the end of the stage.After a plane journey across France and a rest day, the race resumed in Perigueux for a flat ride through the lush landscapes of the Dordogne province in southwestern France.There was no major change in the overall standings, with Fabio Aru still in second, 18 seconds behind Froome, and the Frenchman Romain Bardet in third place, 51 seconds back.
