FRANKFURT — German prosecutors said on Friday that they were investigating possible fraud in connection with expense money paid by Volkswagen to a labor representative on the company’s supervisory board, raising the specter of another scandal at the carmaker.Volkswagen confirmed in a statement that the investigation, by prosecutors in Braunschweig, near company headquarters in Wolfsburg, involved Bernd Osterloh, the chairman of the carmaker’s works council and one of the most powerful labor leaders in Germany.The company said it had already commissioned a review by an outside expert, who concluded that money paid to Mr. Osterloh “complies with all legal requirements in every respect.” A spokesman for Mr. Osterloh did not immediately reply to a request for comment.The latest investigation comes only two months after Volkswagen pleaded guilty in the United States to charges related to its attempt to dupe regulators about the emissions of diesel cars.The investigation could cast doubt on Volkswagen’s assurances, repeated on Wednesday at the annual shareholders meeting, that it is creating a more ethical company culture.The action by prosecutors is also sure to stir up memories of a scandal a decade ago in which Volkswagen money was used to supply labor leaders with prostitutes during lavish “pleasure trips.”That scandal led to the criminal convictions in 2008 of Peter Hartz, the Volkswagen personnel director, and Klaus Volkert, then the head of the works council. Shortly before the scandal came to light, Mr. Osterloh succeeded Mr. Volkert as chairman of the council, which under German law has broad powers to influence company policy.All publicly listed companies in Germany have a works council, and in addition, labor representatives hold half the seats on the company’s supervisory board.At Volkswagen, the works council is separate from the IG Metall union that represents Volkswagen workers, but they cooperate closely.And even by German standards, workers at Volkswagen are especially powerful because the state of Lower Saxony, where the company is based, owns 20 percent of the voting shares and has two seats on the supervisory board. The politicians who occupy the state’s seats almost always side with labor, giving workers the de facto majority, meaning they have the power to hire and fire top managers.The system gives top executives a strong incentive to keep the chairman of the works council happy, and it was at the root of the “pleasure trips” scandal in 2008. Investors have often complained about Volkswagen’s governance system, saying that it insulated top management from outside scrutiny and helped create a climate where the emissions scandal could breed.Volkswagen can ill afford another blow to its reputation. The company said on Friday that deliveries in April slipped 1.4 percent to 841,000 vehicles worldwide, largely because of slumping sales in Germany and other European countries.The Braunschweig state’s attorney’s office provided no details about the sums of money involved in the reported wrongdoing. But, in an emailed statement, the prosecutors said they had concluded that there was enough evidence to warrant an official investigation.
