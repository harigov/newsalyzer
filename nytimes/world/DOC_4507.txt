LONDON — The draft of a treaty to ban cluster munitions was adopted by a group of 111 nations on Wednesday in Dublin after Britain dropped its longstanding opposition to any limitations on the weapons.The sudden shift by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is under pressure to combat his Labor Party’s declining political fortunes, created fresh pressures on the United States, which had counted Britain as one of its staunchest allies in opposing the ban.The treaty, hammered out in two weeks of talks in Dublin, had been under negotiation since February 2007. The nations accepting the treaty are scheduled to gather again in Oslo in early December to sign the pact, which would ban the use, production and sale of cluster munitions.The draft treaty would still leave most of the world’s stockpile of cluster weapons untouched, as the United States has been joined in its outright opposition to the ban, and in its boycott of the Dublin conference, by a group of military powers that includes China, Russia, Israel, India, Pakistan and Brazil.Weapons experts estimate that the United States, China and Russia each have at least a billion cluster munitions, counting the individual “bomblets” that are carried by each weapon, dwarfing the stockpiles of states that have accepted the treaty.But supporters of the treaty  said that its impact would be felt even by those nations that refused to sign, much as those countries that have rejected the 1997 Ottawa treaty on land mines, including the United States, have refrained from using mines since that treaty was adopted.“We have a strong treaty,” said Simon Conway, a former British soldier who is a co-chairman of the Anti-Cluster Campaign, a coalition of more than 200 groups that have worked for a cluster munitions ban. “The treaty will stigmatize the use of cluster munitions, and those countries that have not signed up will not be able to use them.”Cluster munitions is the term used for weapons fired from aircraft and artillery that contain dozens, or even hundreds, of bomblets that can remain active long after the weapon is fired, posing deadly risks to civilians. Used by the United States and Britain in Iraq during the invasion of 2003, and by Israel in its incursion into Lebanon in 2006, the weapons have been blamed for the deaths of hundreds of civilians. Human rights groups estimate that one in four of the casualties have been children playing with the unexploded bomblets.The draft treaty sets an eight-year deadline for signatory nations to destroy most of their stockpiles of cluster weapons, along with other provisions that delegates said would ultimately eliminate all but a small fraction of cluster munitions in nations that sign the treaty. It also obliges nations that adopt it to provide “technical, financial or material assistance” for clearing up cluster munitions “remnants” that remain on the territory of other states.The proposed treaty would not ban a new lightweight generation of so-called smart cluster munitions, each carrying fewer than 10 bomblets and designed to self-destruct within a short period after impact, if they have not detonated against a target.These currently account for only a small part of the American inventory of cluster munitions, but the Bush administration has argued that a shift to these new weapons, which pose a much lower risk to civilians, makes a ban of the kind called for in the treaty unnecessary.In Washington on Wednesday, a Bush administration spokesman said that, while sharing the “humanitarian concerns of those in Dublin,” the White House remained opposed to the draft treaty. “Cluster munitions have demonstrated military utility,” said the spokesman, Tom Casey of the State Department, “and their elimination from U.S. stockpiles would put the lives of our soldiers and those of our coalition partners at risk.”Supporters said that in addition to stigmatizing the use of traditional cluster munitions, the treaty would hasten the transition to the new generation of “smart” weapons that self-destruct. And they pointed to Britain’s support of the ban, after years of resistance, as a watershed moment that would stand alongside the treaty that banned land mines.The land mine pact has been shunned by a relatively small group of military powers, including the United States, but advocates of the cluster munitions treaty said that the decision by Britain — a major American ally, one of the most important military powers in NATO, and a member of the United Nations Security Council — could create fresh pressures on the United States, particularly after Mr. Bush leaves office next January.That hope was voiced at the Dublin conference on Tuesday by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He told the conference that “anyone who has seen the indiscriminate devastation cluster weapons cause across a wide area must recognize the unacceptable threat they pose to civilians.”He added: “As I have said many times, among the first tasks of our next president will be to reintroduce America to the world. We need to reject the ‘us versus them’ unilateralist approach that has so diminished our image and our leadership.”Among the presidential contenders, only Senator Barack Obama has supported a ban on cluster munitions. In a Senate vote in 2006, both Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator John McCain voted against it, while Senator Obama was one of only four senators to support the motion.The turnaround by Britain came at a time of mounting political pressure on Mr. Brown from within the governing Labor Party after a series of sharp electoral setbacks, including the loss of a previously safe Labor parliamentary seat in a by-election in Britain’s industrial midlands last week. The electoral setbacks, and opinion polls that have depicted Mr. Brown as Britain’s most unpopular prime minister in decades, have prompted several recent policy changes, including a $5.3 billion income tax rebate announced earlier this month.Negotiators in Dublin also resolved a dispute over a section of the treaty that deals with the responsibilities, and potential legal liabilities, of signatory states that cooperate in battlefield situations with nations that have not joined the ban — something the United States had lobbied for energetically.In a concession to Britain, Australia and other American military allies, the draft treaty contains a permissive provision stating that the troops of signatory nations “may engage in military cooperation and operations with states not party to this convention that might engage” in the use of cluster munitions.It seemed likely that the treaty would also skirt another potential snarl, allowing the United States to continue to maintain the stockpiles of cluster munitions that it has at bases in countries that plan to join the ban, including Britain and Germany.
