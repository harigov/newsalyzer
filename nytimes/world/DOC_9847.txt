Rising emissions of carbon dioxide create twin threats for coral in oceans around the world: warmer temperatures, which can cause mass bleachings, and ocean acidification, which can hinder the animals’ ability to build reefs.But a new study published on Friday in the journal Science Advances suggests that ocean acidification may be the bigger worry in some waters.Studying a chain of remote Australian islands in the Indian Ocean, researchers found that more acidic waters (those that have absorbed more atmospheric carbon dioxide) cause serious skeletal deformities in juvenile coral in subtropical waters.Using 3-D imaging techniques, they saw that young coral from the Houtman Abrolhos islands developed skeletons that were missing sections or had very porous and fragile surfaces.Other studies have shown similar effects of ocean acidification, but the researchers also discovered something that had not been seen in earlier studies of tropical coral development — higher temperatures didn’t have a negative effect on coral skeleton formation.In fact, warmer temperatures seemed to lessen the effects of carbon dioxide.Speaking from the Philippines, Taryn Foster, the study’s lead researcher and apparent island-hopper, offered a possible reason for the positive effect of higher temperatures: “Juvenile corals move a lot, sometimes hundreds of kilometers, so they might need to withstand a range of temperatures in their life cycle.”But even if warmer temperatures aren’t a problem for coral in the subtropics, the effects of ocean acidification are still worrisome, Dr. Foster said, because young coral help reefs maintain genetic diversity and recover after damaging events.However, she was cautious about the implications for global reef development: “This is only one species of coral, and we think this is unique to the subtropics.”
