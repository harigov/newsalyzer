(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Republican Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Mike Lee of Utah declared Monday night they would oppose the Senate Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, for now killing a seven-year-old promise to overturn President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.The absence of Senator John McCain because of emergency cranial surgery had already been seen as a factor that could delay a vote on the Republicans’ health care bill for a week or more.Earlier, President Trump laid claim to having signed more bills “than any president, ever.” Our analysis is that, in fact, he is slightly behind the pace of the last six presidents, and that about half the bills he signed were minor and inconsequential._____2. The U.S. government’s top ethics watchdog chief, who is stepping down Tuesday, said the country is “pretty close to a laughingstock at this point.” President Trump’s repeated trips to his family’s business properties — including 40 to a family golf course — “creates the appearance of profiting from the presidency,” he said.Mr. Trump continued to defend his eldest son, though revelations continued to grow about his meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer last year. We looked at a Russian developer the Kremlin may have used as a conduit to the Trumps._____3. Even the farthest reaches of the United States aren’t immune to the national infrastructure crisis.Eight thousand miles from the mainland is the McMurdo Station, home to the most ambitious research program in Antarctica for 50 years. The station’s buildings are aging and inefficient, and the price tags for replacements are high.Efforts to cut federal spending leave the McMurdo’s fate unclear._____4. South Korea reached out to North Korea, offering to hold military and humanitarian talks at their heavily armed border, above, this Friday and even to arrange reunions for families divided decades ago by the Korean War.The new South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has proved more interested in engaging with the North than President Trump’s advisers.The South’s overture comes as the U.N. Security Council is discussing a new set of sanctions against the North over its recent ICBM test, and as a South Korean-born American peace activist, Christine Ahn, was denied entry by the South on the grounds that she might “hurt the national interests and public safety.”_____5. Tens of thousands of people who took out private loans to pay for college may get their debts wiped away.The National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts has repeatedly failed to prove the current ownership of loans that, in an echo of the subprime mortgage crisis, it initially made through banks and then sold to investors. The troubled loans total at least $5 billion.Trying to avoid loans all together? Here’s what you need to know about saving for college._____6. Before Cosmo DiNardo confessed to the brutal killings of four young men in Bucks County, Pa., friends and neighbors described signs of a volatile, bullying personality getting worse over time.“He’s been talking about killing people since he was 14,” one friend said._____7. “This is no longer a coastal, elite housing problem. This is a problem in big swaths of the state.”That’s Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator in California, on the extreme rise in housing costs. He is sponsoring a bill to crack down on communities that are not doing enough to bring in affordable housing._____8. Aaron Judge is hitting homers like no other rookie before him.The musclebound, 6-7 Yankees outfielder spent the winter tinkering with his swing after a dismal introduction to the majors last August. Now, our baseball columnist writes, his technique “is a portrait of technical precision that has allowed his rare physical gifts to flourish.”In basketball, the Houston Rockets are unexpectedly up for sale. Leslie Alexander paid $85 million 24 years ago for the team, which is now valued at more than $1.6 billion._____9. What qualifies as “appropriate dress” these days?The U.S. House of Representatives was criticized for turning away a female reporter in a sleeveless dress, not so different from the one Melania Trump wore above, and the L.P.G.A. issued guidelines prohibiting golfers from wearing too-short skirts.Social media, and our fashion critic, weigh in._____10. Long before “The Walking Dead” or “Get Out,” there was George Romero.The godfather of zombie movies, who died Sunday at the age of 77, introduced filmgoers to a new type of mainstream monster through “Night of the Living Dead,” pictured above, but he never left the living off the hook, either.Times film critics discuss his towering influence on horror, and take a look at his five most memorable films.Have a wonderful evening.Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
