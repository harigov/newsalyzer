New York Times reporters and editors are highlighting great stories from around the web. You can receive What We’re Reading by email, and let us know how you like it at wwr@nytimes.com.From Bitter Southerner: Like a lot of liberals in small Southern towns, Chuck Reese always felt like a misfit. It’s probably why he was able to write such an intimate profile of the comedy trio Liberal Rednecks for Bitter Southerner, the publication he edits. You’ll learn a lot about the comedians, but you’ll also walk away with a new appreciation for a rising class of left-leaning Southerners who are still as country as they come. — Kim Severson, national food correspondent_____From The Times: We have another double scoop of partisan writing. Earlier this week, we rounded up pieces from across the political spectrum discussing the disclosure of Donald Trump Jr.’s emails about meeting with a Russian lawyer. And today, we have more on that topic, as well as on the F.B.I.’s future and the health care bill. — Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist_____From BuzzFeed: Why is Muhammad Ali’s faith so rarely mentioned publicly? One of America’s best-known Muslims is rarely acknowledged as such on his public social media feeds, and this thoughtful piece explores why. — Prashant Rao, deputy Europe business editor_____From Granta: Here, a United Nations official whose grandparents fled China reflects on the struggle of countless Rohingya. These people, a Muslim ethnic group, are denied citizenship in Myanmar, and many have had to flee. The writer considers what their plight says about transnational identities like his own. — Patrick Boehler, briefings team_____From Epic: The story of Jack Foster is one you have probably not heard. Part literary probe and part American ethnography, this article, “What Goes Up,” chronicles the fateful day (in Carefree, Ariz.) that delivered the helicopter from its militarized stigma into myriad other uses, like civil search-and-rescue, pesticide control and action news. It is also a story about knowing that nothing can stay aloft forever, even Mr. Foster. — Kenneth R. Rosen, senior news assistant_____From Quartz: For book lovers, a surprising reflection on the joys of slow reading, as in taking weeks, months or years to finish a book. “It’s a refusal to hurry up or to turn reading into a life hack; it’s the anti-summer reading, the anti-binge read. It’s site-specific, intensely slow reading, for no other reason than to bask in what’s good.” — Tara Parker-Pope, Well columnist
