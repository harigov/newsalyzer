He performed stunts for “Get Out,” “The Fate of the Furious” and “Logan,” all of which came out this year. He had also worked on two of the “Hunger Games” movies and several other major studio productions in recent years.The actor Bailey Chase, for whom Mr. Bernecker was a stunt double on Fox’s “24: Legacy,” remembered him in a tweet as “beyond professional.”Several current and former actors on “The Walking Dead,” which concluded its seventh season this year, also offered condolences after the accident.“Our thoughts are with John Bernecker’s family,” Major Dodson, who played the actor Sam Anderson on the show, said on Twitter on Thursday night.A spokesman for the television industry’s union, SAG-Aftra, told Variety that it was investigating the accident.
