JAKARTA, Indonesia — Visitors to Art Basel in Hong Kong will have the opportunity to discover sculpture art by Darbotz, a 33-year-old Indonesian graffiti artist.Visitors from Jakarta, however, will already be familiar with his work through the spray-paint designs and his signature “squid” figure, which dot the public buses and crumbling walls of the city that provides both his inspiration and his canvas.Darbotz started tagging in 1997 during the downfall of the authoritarian leader Suharto. Like his fellow graffiti artist Banksy, Darbotz will not reveal his name or face for fear of legal repercussions.While studying graphic design at university in 2001, Darbotz learned about semiotics theory and developed a desire for a symbol that would represent him. He chose the cumi, or squid in Indonesian — a round ball with bulging, creased eyes and teethlike tentacles.In global folklore the squid is a feared and legendary monster, much like what Darbotz says he feels about metropolitan Jakarta, with its population of 28 million, its clutter and constriction, its gridlocked traffic and garbage eyesores.“I try to visualize the city of Jakarta in its own chaos,” he said during a recent interview. “It’s a messed-up thing in a beautiful way, aesthetically and literally.He added, “Jakarta is not a nice place, but in my own interpretation, of what I feel about Jakarta, it is.”Gallery owners began noticing his work and inviting him to show with them; international commissions followed. A breakthrough solo exhibition in 2010, “Monster Goes Out At Night,” at Jakarta’s d gallerie, included works using canvas, wood and resin — an unusual jump for most graffiti artists.Sueo Mizuma, founder of the Mizuma Art Gallery in Tokyo, discovered Darbotz’s work while in Yogyakarta, southeast of Jakarta, for the annual Art Jog festival in 2013. A sculpture caught his eye: “Island of the Walls,” which used resin to evoke the artist’s traditional canvas of crumbling urban walls.“The power of Darbotz’s piece was evident,” Mr. Mizuma wrote in an email. “Ironically, his artwork was displayed and confined within walls, but the allocation to an alien environment didn’t shut up the cosmopolitan edge from the work.”Mizuma Gallery of Singapore, an offshoot of the Tokyo gallery, began representing Darbotz in late 2013, adding him to its roster of Japanese contemporary artists such as Akira Yamaguchi and Makoto Aida.As part of the gallery’s Art Basel in Hong Kong exhibition, Darbotz will show “King of Jakarta,” a resin sculpture of one of the city’s iconic orange public buses bedecked with his graffiti. The bus stands on four legs sporting Nike sneakers and King Kong appendages.“What’s great about him is he’s still under the radar,” Galuh Sukardi, a junior specialist for Sotheby’s Southeast Asian paintings, said of Darbotz. “His work can be commercial and at the same time anonymous, because people don’t know him unless you are in the arts world or are someone familiar with the urban scene in Indonesia.”As Jakarta embarks on an effort to clean up its buildings, some of Darbotz’s original graffiti work is starting to disappear. One site will probably remain untouched for now: the ArtOtel Jakarta Thamrin, an eight-story boutique hotel in the city center. Darbotz spent three weeks hoisted perilously above the city on a hanging gondola with seven assistants to decorate three walls of the hotel, which displays and promotes the work of young artists.This and other commercial collaborations over the years, with Google Chrome, Gap, JanSport and Nike, among others, have burnished Darbotz’s global reputation, though the artist maintains he has not forsaken his ties to the Jakarta graffiti community.“I do shows in the gallery and do commercial things, but I still know where I come from and I still paint in the street,” he said. “If a security guard ever stops me, I just say I am making something beautiful,” he added.
