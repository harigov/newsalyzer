KABUL, Afghanistan —  Two days after acknowledging that its supreme commander, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was dead, the Taliban released an audio recording said to be from the group’s new leader.In it, the new leader, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, declared that “the jihad will continue until there is an Islamic system” in Afghanistan, and he called on the Taliban to remain unified just as they had when Mullah Omar was at the helm.He called on the insurgents to pray for “the strength and courage to follow the path of Mullah Omar,” the founding leader of the Taliban who had not been seen in public since late 2001, when his government in Afghanistan fell.Mullah Omar’s fate had been unknown until last week, when the Afghan government announced that he had died more than two years ago in a Pakistani hospital. A day later, the Taliban confirmed that Mullah Omar had died, but said little about the timing and claimed that he had never left Afghanistan, which he governed from 1996 to 2001.Mullah Mansour seemed to dismiss the prospect of peace talks as enemy propaganda, despite the fact that he was said to have approved a historic face-to-face meeting in early July between delegations from the Taliban and the Afghan government. That meeting, arranged by Pakistan, was seen as a potential first step toward negotiations between the two sides. After Mullah Omar’s death was announced, Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said the next round of talks, scheduled for Friday, had been postponed at the Taliban’s request.But in the recording, which was released on Saturday, Mullah Mansour said that claims of any “peace process” or negotiations were merely “the words of the enemies.”Still, the Afghan government and Western diplomats are likely to find some cause for hope in what Mullah Mansour said, and did not say. His address did not explicitly rule out future contact for the government. And he defined the goal of the insurgency as “an Islamic system” in Kabul, rather than explicitly speaking in terms of the Taliban reconquering Afghanistan.The speech, according to the Taliban’s most prominent spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, was made to a special gathering of Taliban leaders, scholars and clerics. Mr. Mujahid said that the meeting occurred the same day that Mullah Mansour was selected to replace Mullah Omar and that several people in attendance made an oath of allegiance to Mullah Mansour.The selection of Mullah Mansour, who has been the insurgency’s de facto leader for several years, occurred with surprising speed given the Taliban’s byzantine command structure across numerous power centers in several Pakistani cities.Mullah Mansour’s selection appears to have the backing of a broad array of Taliban leaders. They include his onetime rival, a top Taliban military commander, as well as the hard-line Haqqani wing, which is now well represented at the top of the Taliban command structure.A few dissident voices have emerged, however, to claim that Mullah Mansour’s selection was the work of a small faction of his supporters and that a far larger gathering of Taliban leaders is necessary to select Mullah Omar’s successor.Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, who was a provincial governor in the north and west of Afghanistan during the Taliban era, said in an interview Saturday that “the great mujahedeen, clerics, fighting commanders who have been part of the Islamic emirate for 20 years were all excluded from the succession meeting.”Mullah Niazi added that the family of Mullah Omar, particularly his brother and son, was “not happy” with the appointment. Mullah Niazi, who does not have a current position in the Taliban leadership, has emerged as a spokesman for those opposing Mullah Mansour’s selection.It is difficult to gauge whether the challengers have much of a following or whether they pose a significant threat to Mullah Mansour’s leadership.Still, at one point, Mullah Mansour said he was ready to step down, “if I am a cause of disunity, and with my removal unity will follow.”Over the course of the half-hour speech, Mullah Mansour repeatedly exhorted his audience to be on guard against factionalism and enemy propaganda that might breed distrust.“The enemies have tried a lot, with the help of money and media and many other ways, to weaken the morale for jihad and destroy our unity,” he said.Mullah Mansour is sometimes described by analysts as among the Taliban’s more “moderate” leaders, but what that means is unclear in the context of an insurgency that has been waged for more than a decade and that over the years has increasingly used suicide bombers.This summer, the insurgency has made significant gains, particularly in the northern part of the country, far from its traditional territory. But Afghan security forces, facing mounting casualties and losing ground in the countryside, have managed to hold onto nearly every one of the country’s roughly 400 district centers.The Taliban have faced bruising skirmishes in the important eastern province of Nangarhar, where a number of insurgent units loyal to the Islamic State quickly established themselves as the dominant force in some districts.
