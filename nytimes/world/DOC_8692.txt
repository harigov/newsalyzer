NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuters) — A Kenyan court on Monday ordered the government to arrest President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges, should he ever return to Kenya.The ruling prompted Sudan to order the expulsion of Kenya’s ambassador and summon its own envoy from Nairobi.Kenya was heavily criticized by the International Criminal Court and foreign governments for failing to arrest Mr. Bashir when he attended a ceremony in Kenya last year.The African Union has told its members not to enforce the arrest warrant for Mr. Bashir, which is linked to his government’s crackdown on rebels in the Darfur region, saying the court was singling out African leaders. However, as a signatory to the court, Kenya is obliged to cooperate with it.The Kenyan court ordered Mr. Bashir’s arrest in response to a suit against the attorney general and the internal security minister seeking a new arrest warrant for Mr. Bashir. Judge Nicholas Ombija ordered that Mr. Bashir should be apprehended “should he set foot in Kenya in future.”In response, Sudan gave Kenya’s ambassador in Khartoum 72 hours to leave the country and summoned its ambassador from Nairobi, according to Sudan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, El-Obeid Morawah.
