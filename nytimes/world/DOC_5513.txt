LONDON —  Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday formally laid out Britain’s conditions for remaining in the European Union, seeking changes in his country’s relationship with Brussels that he is betting are substantial enough to win over a majority of British voters but modest enough for the rest of Europe to swallow.In a speech here and a written letter of proposals for reform, Mr. Cameron called on fellow European leaders to grant him a series of concessions to help persuade wavering Britons to remain in a bloc that critics say has become a vast bureaucracy impinging on their national sovereignty and way of life. Mr. Cameron has promised to put the issue to a referendum by the end of 2017, and his aides suggest that he might do so as early as next June.In his speech, Mr. Cameron told British voters that their decision would be crucial and the final say on the issue — a “once-in-a-generation choice.” He said, “You will hold this country’s destiny in your hands; this is a huge decision for our country, perhaps the biggest we will make in our lifetimes.”The negotiation over Britain’s demands will also be a crucial test for nations, starting with Germany and France, that are struggling to maintain cohesion and a sense of progress within the bloc after years in which economic stagnation, rising populism and assertive nationalism have undercut their plans to bind the Continent’s governments and people more closely together.After months of quiet talks with European leaders, who generally want Britain to stay but are resistant to any changes to the bloc’s main principles, Mr. Cameron is hoping to get the basics of a deal done at the next European Union summit meeting in mid-December, or failing that, at an emergency summit meeting early next year. His aides say he does not want to drag out the referendum, with some suggesting that he would prefer to have it before what could be another chaotic summer of migrant flows to Europe. The handling of that issue has already undermined the reputation of the European Union in British eyes.Mr. Cameron’s demands included a safeguard to prevent countries that use the euro from discriminating economically against Britain, which has retained the pound, and an end to Britain’s legal commitment, as a signatory to European Union treaties, to pursue an “ever closer union,” which conservatives see as a threat to national sovereignty. He also called for a reduction in regulatory red tape as a way of improving economic competitiveness.Crucially, he said that Britain should have the right to restrict welfare entitlements, including benefits for low-income workers, for four years for migrants arriving from other European countries. That is widely regarded as his most difficult demand because it would be a departure from current European rules stipulating that citizens of all countries in the bloc should be treated equally — a point made by European officials on Tuesday.Mr. Cameron has made clear that he wants a deal that will allow Britain to stay, but in an effort to retain negotiating leverage and credibility with the anti-European right wing of his Conservative Party, he has also signaled that he is willing to walk away if necessary and that he believes that Britain could do just fine on its own if the union does not grant him what he wants. The British public remains roughly split on the merits of membership in the bloc, according to opinion polls.Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute, said Mr. Cameron was striking a tricky balance.“The speech has both pro-European elements — preparing the case to keep Britain in the European Union — and language that is much more aggressive,” he said.“He’s trying to show that he’s not a pushover,” Mr. Leonard added. “He has at least to keep up the appearance that he is willing to walk away because that is the logic in which the whole renegotiation is founded.”Nigel Lawson, a prominent Conservative and former chancellor who is campaigning for Britain to leave the union, described Mr. Cameron’s goals as “disappointingly unambitious.” Dominic Cummings, director of the Vote Leave campaign, said he expected Mr. Cameron “to get what he’s asking for — but what he’s asking for is trivial.”The most difficult aspect of the negotiation is likely to be over the demand for changes to the rules regarding social welfare payments to migrants. Mr. Cameron is seeking the step as a way of reducing immigration at a time when high joblessness on the Continent is leading many Europeans to seek work in Britain’s relatively strong economy.Other European governments have made clear that they will not alter what they view as a foundation of the European Union — the principle of freedom of movement and labor within the bloc — to accommodate Britain.That has threatened Mr. Cameron’s plan to try to temporarily limit benefits to new European migrants, thereby reducing the incentive for them to come to Britain. But because his partners will not accept discrimination, he will have to apply those limits to new British employees, too — unless he can win an exemption from the rules from other European leaders.Margaritis Schinas, a spokesman for the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, underlined the sensitivity of the issue, saying that some of Mr. Cameron’s proposals “are highly problematic, as they touch upon the fundamental freedoms of our internal market.” He added, “Direct discrimination between E.U. citizens clearly falls into this last category.”In a letter to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, giving details about what concessions he wanted, Mr. Cameron signaled some flexibility on the issue of benefits for migrants.“I understand how difficult some of these issues are for other member states, and I look forward to discussing these proposals further so we can find a solution that deals with this issue,” Mr. Cameron wrote in the letter to Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, a country with hundreds of thousands of citizens working in Britain.Mr. Cameron promised a plebiscite nearly three years ago to calm anti-European sentiment in his Conservative Party, a decision that now leaves him with one of the most difficult political challenges of his tenure.Having held the United Kingdom together last year by squeaking out a victory against separatists in the Scottish independence referendum, Mr. Cameron may face a more difficult task now because few Britons feel much of an emotional tie to the European Union.Mr. Cameron’s demand that Britain be exempted from Europe’s commitment to an “ever closer union” is indicative of his efforts to assuage some of the criticism in Britain of European aims. The phrase, which dates to the founding documents of one of the current union’s precursors, is important to anti-Europeans because it suggests to them a continual ceding of authority to Brussels. But the phrase actually talks of “an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe” — not necessarily among its governments — and in any case it is more aspirational than prescriptive.In a passage welcomed by pro-Europeans, Mr. Cameron said that while Britain could survive outside the bloc, leaving it would not lead the nation automatically to a “land of milk and honey,” and that any decision to quit should be made “with our eyes open.”But he also warned that if he failed to reach his negotiating objectives and his requests fell on “deaf ears,” Britain “would have to think again” about membership.Mr. Leonard argued that Mr. Cameron’s concerns were significant but not important enough to outweigh the benefits of membership in the bloc.“It’s a bit like threatening to walk out on a marriage of four decades because your husband doesn’t put the top on the toothpaste tube,” he said.
