The Emmys once again hit a new low in viewership Sunday night, with 11.3 million people tuning into the ceremony on ABC, according to Nielsen.It’s the second consecutive year that the Emmys has drawn its lowest telecast ever. Last year, when the Emmys was broadcast on Fox, it had 11.9 million viewers.The Emmy numbers follow a trend for slumping awards shows. The Oscars hit an eight-year low this year, and the Grammys hit a seven-year low. MTV’s “Video Music Awards” lost a third of its audience last month compared with the year before.The industry is trying to come to terms with the factors contributing to these declines. Some executives argue that it’s the cyclical nature of awards shows, which fall in and out of favor; others argue that consumer behavior is finally affecting big live event programming, which was supposed to be immune to an industrywide trend of declining ratings.Still others say that given the abundance of TV shows these days, many people are unfamiliar with the awards winners at the Emmys. Rami Malek won best actor for his role in “Mr. Robot,” but that series has little more than a million viewers. Likewise, Tatiana Maslany won best actress in a drama for “Orphan Black,” and though it is a critical hit, the show is not broadly popular. Only 695,000 people watched that show’s season finale this year, according to Nielsen.The Emmys had its usual competition — professional football — and was up against the Vikings-Packers game on NBC.
