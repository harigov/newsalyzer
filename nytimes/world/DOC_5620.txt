PETERBOROUGH, Ontario — This time last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was both a novelty and a star at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But rather than rub shoulders with the billionaires, bankers and potentates again this year, Mr. Trudeau has set off on a nationwide tour of banquet halls, cafes and highway rest stops.His decision to hang around with Canadian voters and schoolchildren instead of the high and mighty comes as Mr. Trudeau’s image as a nothing-to-hide champion of the middle class is showing a few dents.Some of those dings have come from his holiday plans: He and his family spent part of the recent Christmas holidays on a private island in the Bahamas as guests of the Aga Khan, the billionaire philanthropist and spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims. The parliamentary commissioner for ethics and conflicts of interest said on Monday that she was investigating the propriety of the trip.Mr. Trudeau was under fire even before the trip, for serving as the main attraction at Liberal party fund-raisers where small crowds, often dominated by wealthy investors and business executives, paid 1,500 Canadian dollars ($1,147) apiece for the chance to socialize with him. Events like that, common in American politics, are seen as less savory in Canada, where campaign contributions are tightly restricted.“Justin Trudeau believes that laws don’t apply to people like him,” Rona Ambrose, the interim leader of the opposition Conservative Party, wrote on Twitter on Monday. “He’s wrong. It’s time he starts putting ordinary Canadians first.”Several polls show that Mr. Trudeau remains very popular, but even so, his January road show has all the earmarks of a campaign to reconnect with voters. At the first few stops, it has also shown Mr. Trudeau practicing politics without a safety net.The large crowds he draws have generally been friendly, but there have also been tears, anger and pointed questions, including some for which Mr. Trudeau acknowledges he does not have good answers.Above all, there has been keen interest.The setting booked for Mr. Trudeau’s appearance in Peterborough, Ontario, last Friday was the Evinrude Centre, a cavernous banquet hall attached to a hockey rink complex. Even so, it was filled to its legal capacity well before Mr. Trudeau arrived, and organizers had to start turning people away. Several dozen latecomers stood outside in the biting cold to listen to the proceedings on loudspeakers.Mr. Trudeau’s town-hall-style event in London, Ontario, later that day had to be relocated three times to successively larger sites, and people were still shut out. And his appearance in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Monday was eventually moved to a 3,000-seat arena.The unemployment rate in Peterborough, a city of 74,600 in a popular vacation area about an hour northeast of Toronto, is unusually low right now at 4.5 percent. But many of its traditional large industrial employers have either cut payrolls or moved work elsewhere since Canada signed free trade agreements with the United States and Mexico.The building across the street from the Evinrude Centre is an illustration. These days it houses the Canadian Canoe Museum, which, as Mr. Trudeau noted, includes a birch bark canoe and a buckskin jacket that belonged to his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who was also a Liberal prime minister. But until 1990, the building was a factory producing Evinrude and Johnson outboard motors. Bombardier Recreational Products of Valcourt, Quebec, owns the company now, but the motors it sells in Canada are made in the United States.A university, a college, government and health care employment and Peterborough’s growing popularity with retirees have helped offset the city’s lost manufacturing jobs. But a sense of economic unease was still evident in the questions Mr. Trudeau fielded from his audience.He got an earful, for instance, about steep rises in electricity bills, even though the province of Ontario sets the rates, not the national government. One woman, who said she was a single mother and spoke on the verge of tears, produced a recent monthly bill for 1,085 Canadian dollars. Cries of “shame, shame, shame” echoed through the hall.Standing in front of an oversize Canadian flag with the sleeves of his light-blue dress shirt rolled up and the top button undone behind his necktie, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that many Canadians feel squeezed financially.“We are facing a big challenge,” he said. “The government should be helping you, not harming you.”In Halifax on Monday, he heard from voters about another looming economic worry: a Trump administration in Washington that dislikes free trade agreements and has hinted at new border taxes on imports from Canada. That could be devastating for Canada’s export-dependent economy, especially its auto industry, which has been integrated with American factories since 1965.Mr. Trudeau said that he did not plan to change Canada’s course to suit Mr. Trump, but he avoided criticizing the incoming president.“We both got elected on a commitment to help the middle class, and we’re going to be able to find common ground on doing the kinds of things that will help ordinary families right across the continent,” he said.Mr. Trudeau was challenged on a variety of issues, including Canada’s official policy of English and French bilingualism, water problems in indigenous communities, the country’s electoral system and immigration — the last from someone who wanted more refugees admitted more quickly.Conspicuously, no one in the crowd asked about the fund-raisers, and references to the vacation with the Aga Khan were limited to mild heckling from two middle-aged men at the back of the room. But those matters continue to dominate news coverage in Canada, and they are what the reporters covering Mr. Trudeau’s tour are asking him about.Mr. Trudeau has known the Aga Khan since childhood. The billionaire was a friend of his father and served as a pallbearer at his father’s funeral, along with Fidel Castro. Canada took in many Ismaili Muslims when they were expelled from Uganda by Idi Amin in 1972, and since then the Aga Khan and his organizations have set up several institutions in Canada, including a museum of Muslim art in Toronto.Mr. Trudeau’s political opponents say that the vacation created a conflict of interest because the government of Canada has donated millions of dollars over the years to humanitarian aid programs organized by charities headed by the Aga Khan. Under an agreement with the previous Conservative government, the Canadian treasury also matched a donation of 30 million Canadian dollars by the Aga Khan to set up a Global Center for Pluralism in Ottawa.Once Mr. Trudeau had posed for his last selfie and lifted up the last baby at the Peterborough stop, several attendees said they were pleased with the event, including some who had questions about certain policies.“I really enjoyed listening to Mr. Trudeau, love the fact that he’s very accessible to us. That’s the big thing,” said Laura Scaife, who had hoped to ask the prime minister to give Canada’s provinces more money for health care. “But he does have a tendency to wander just a bit. I wish his answers had been a bit shorter, so that more people could ask questions.”After the public event came a short news conference and a brief session with volunteers; then Mr. Trudeau waved goodbye. A crew took to the stage to fold up the giant flag, and the prime minister’s caravan of seven black sport utility vehicles and vans set off for the next stop.
