City Lacks Form Citizens Need To Press Fight on Air Pollution - The New York Times
NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA,AIR POLLUTION

Eight months after Mayor Lindsay signed into law an air pollution control code that he described as “the toughest and most comprehensive in the na tion,” citizens still have not been able to obtain the basic forms that would allow them to press action against pol luters.When the code was an nounced city officials, includ ing Jerome Kretchmer, the En vironmental Protection Admin istrator, said one of its major features was to encourage direct citizen involvement in pollution control for the first time.The new code provided that if the city's Department of Air Resources did not act on a legit imate citizen complaint within 45 days a citizen could initiate action himself that would be prosecuted in the new Environ mental Control Board that was set up to bypass the cumber some court process.Earlier this year a group called the Upper West Side Air Pollution Campaign was orga nized to go after landlords who had not complied with laws re quiring the upgrading of smoky incinerators and oil burners.The campaign group, direct ed by Marcy Benstock, a 30‐ year‐old former associate of Ralph Nader, began a build ing‐by‐building investigation on the West Side from 72d Street to 110th Street and from River side Drive to Central Park West.Last month, after the 45 days had elapsed since the filing of the initial complaints and no action had been reported from the Department of Air Re sources, Miss Benstock asked for the necessary forms to take action directly with the En vironmental Control Board.The law provides that while a citizen may take direct ac tion if the city does not act the process must be initiated on special forms provided by the city.Last week, Miss Benstock said, she asked for the forms again after determining that the city had taken no action on a citizens complaint filed Jan. 18, almost three months ago, against 315‐321 West 94th Street. Department of Air Re sources records show the build ing was never awarded a cer tificate of operation for its boiler.Reached by telephone in the offices of the Environmental Control Board in the old New York Sun Building at Broad way and Chambers Street, Her bert Johnson, the board's direc tor, said with some irritation that the forms were not ready “because of the 105 million things piled on my desk.”Informed of the lack of forms, Mr. Kretchmer, who is exofficio chairman of the environmental board, said that he was upset about it and that he had ordered that emergency mimeographed copies of the form be made available within a day or two.
