Q. Are children usually taller than their parents?A. The results vary from child to child and family to family, and depend on genes and environmental factors, especially nutrition.Doctors often use a fairly simple formula to predict the adult height of a child based on the heights of the parents. That formula, dating from 1970 research, predicts that most (but not all) children eventually will reach a height somewhere within a fairly small range that can be estimated by the average combined height of their parents.For boys, the formula combines the height of both parents, adds five inches (or 13 centimeters) and divides by two.For girls, it combines the height of the parents, subtracts five inches and divides by two. A more complex formula accounts for extremes in parental height.Obviously, not all children of the same parents, nor even those of the same sex, end up the same height. Adult height tends to decrease in younger siblings, and younger children may grow more slowly.Other factors are involved in growing taller, most notably nutrition, but genetics is estimated to account for 60 percent to 80 percent of one’s final height. A 2000 study of 8,798 pairs of adult Finnish twins, published in the journal Behavior Genetics, found that heritability accounted for around 78 percent of height in adult men and 75 percent in women. question@nytimes.com
