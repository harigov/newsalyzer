HONG KONG — Although a proposed constitution drafted by Thailand’s military government has been endorsed by a majority of voters, regional returns show that deep political divides remain, analysts said on Monday.Majorities in the capital, Bangkok, and throughout central Thailand supported the proposed constitution in a referendum on Sunday, but most voters in large areas of the far north, northeast and south opposed it, according to preliminary results issued by the election commission.With 94 percent of the votes counted, 61.4 percent of voters supported the proposal and 38.6 percent opposed it. A second question in the referendum, on whether a junta-appointed Senate would have a role in choosing the prime minister, was endorsed by 58.1 percent and opposed by 41.9 percent. An official tally is expected by Wednesday.The draft document gives the military a powerful role in future governments while reducing the influence of political parties and direct elections. Thailand’s government has been overturned by military coups 13 times since absolute monarchy ended in 1932, including the coup in 2014 that put the current junta in place.The returns from the voting on Sunday reflected Thailand’s political divisions, as opposition to the proposals came from the largely rural northeast. The area, the Isaan region, supported the former prime ministers Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile, and his sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was removed from office by a court in 2014 shortly before the most recent coup.The measure was also opposed in the far south, where there is a Muslim majority and a long-running separatist movement.“The junta said this would be a part of the national reconciliation, but I would not buy into it,” said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, an associate professor of political science and international relations at Kyoto University in Japan. “You can see the clear division between those who agree and those who disagree.”The authorities banned campaigning against the proposed constitution, and several opponents of the draft document were arrested during the campaign.Ms. Yingluck called the outcome a step back.“I am not surprised about the referendum results, as there was no opportunity to fully express opinions or criticize the content of the constitution draft,” she wrote on Facebook on Monday.“However, I am so sorry and lament for the country, as it’s a move backward to use a constitution that seems to be democratic but is not truly democratic,” she added.The junta said the draft was intended to reduce the possibility of coups, but critics said that it would diminish the role of democracy in the political system.In comments after the vote, the junta chief and prime minister, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, acknowledged the result and attacked overseas critics of the restrictions on campaigning.“To all Thai citizens, whether or not you came out to vote on the referendum today, the government has heard you,” General Prayuth said in a statement released by his office.Foreign governments, including the United States, had urged Thailand to engage in “open dialogue” about the proposed constitution.In his statement, General Prayuth said that he was disappointed by “inappropriate intervention by foreign elements during these delicate times of our political transition.” He continued, “All these interferences have inevitably led us to have contempt for the sentiments of those who claim to be ‘friends’ of Thailand.”The Bangkok Post, an English-language daily, said in an editorial on Monday that the result suggested that Thais wanted the return of civil liberties and the continuation of plans to hold an election for lawmakers, which the government has said should happen before the end of next year.The result “should not be regarded as a mandate for extended military rule,” the newspaper said. “If anything, it was a call to speed up the transition.”
