KABUL â€” A woman election candidate was shot and wounded in the eastern province of Nuristan, and two of her supporters were kidnapped, in an attack just days ahead of the national elections on Sunday, local officials said. The candidate, Hawa Alam Nuristani, a news presenter on the state-run Afghan Television and Radio in Kabul, was traveling by car to a campaign meeting in her native province of Nuristan on Wednesday morning when the attack occurred. "They came under attack by unknown people. She received four rounds from a pistol in her leg," General Abdul Baqi, the police chief of the province, said by telephone. "Two others with her, who were her supporters filming her campaign, were kidnapped." Another woman, the representative of the Women's Affairs Ministry in Nuristan, was also in the car but was not hurt, said the governor of the province, Tamim Nuristani. Hawa Alam Nuristani was treated by American troops in the region and then evacuated to Bagram Air Base, near Kabul, where she was in stable condition, said a U.S. press officer, Sergeant Marina Evans. A spokeswoman for the election commission, Bronwyn Curran, said Nuristani had been shot three times in the hip. Clerics and elders were gathering to try to secure the release of the kidnapped men, the police chief said. Early reports indicated that it was not Taliban or other antigovernment insurgents but the work of rival candidates, he said. Six election candidates and four election workers have been killed in the period before the parliamentary and provincial council elections. Seven police officers were also killed in the southern province of Uruzgan on Wednesday.
