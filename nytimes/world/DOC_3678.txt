Firefighters on the Portuguese island of Madeira continued on Thursday to battle wildfires that have reached Funchal, the island’s largest city, killing three people and destroying over 150 homes, while the national government sought help to deal with nearly 200 blazes on the mainland.Prime Minister António Costa planned to travel to Madeira on Thursday, and Portugal activated a European Union plan to get emergency assistance. Italy has already sent one firefighting aircraft. Madeira is the largest island in an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean that lies about 360 miles off the Moroccan coast, and about 600 miles southwest of Lisbon.The biggest fire on Madeira broke out on Monday and rapidly encroached on the residential outskirts of Funchal, home to about 110,000 people.The fire caused chaos, panic and despair around Funchal. Portuguese television showed elderly people, many of them barefoot or in wheelchairs, being escorted to safety in the middle of the night by emergency services or neighbors. Residents watched in tears as their homes burned down, and some were seen running around helplessly, trying to cover their faces to minimize smoke inhalation.The fires also set off a debate over whether the authorities had responded with sufficient speed and adequate means, especially in light of previous fire disasters in the hot and dry summer months.The police have arrested two people in an inquiry into whether the Madeira fires were started deliberately. People have also been detained on the mainland, where criminal acts are believed to be behind several major fires.By Wednesday afternoon, there were 186 fires burning in mainland Portugal, mostly in the northern part of the country, according to the Civil Protection Agency, a dozen of which were labeled major fires that were out of control.In the first nine days of August, nearly 62,000 acres burned across Portugal, according to the authorities.Strong winds and high temperatures have complicated the efforts of the more than 4,000 firefighters and other emergency workers who have been deployed on Madeira and in mainland Portugal to fight the blazes. One forestry official died on the mainland.The fires also threaten to hurt Portugal’s tourism industry at the peak of the summer vacation season.A luxury hotel on the outskirts of Funchal was among the buildings gutted by fire, and some of the island’s other hotels have been forced to evacuate guests. More than 1,000 residents have been moved to emergency shelters.The Madeira authorities said on Wednesday that two people who had been hospitalized remained in serious condition, and that one person was missing.Mr. Costa’s trip to Madeira is part of a broader effort by the government to evaluate the situation and to determine how much emergency financial aid should be given to Madeira.Thanks to its mild winters, Madeira has developed a year-round tourism industry. The roughly one million visitors each year account for about one-fifth of the region’s economy.Many in Portugal are taking to social media to show solidarity for the firefighters who are risking their lives, often using the hashtag #PrayForPortugal on Twitter.Among those offering financial support is Cristiano Ronaldo, the Real Madrid soccer star and a native of Madeira, who spoke by telephone with Miguel Albuquerque, the president of Madeira’s regional government, according to the Portuguese news media.Fires also raged overnight in southern France, as nearly 1,800 firefighters battled blazes that had already burned over 8,000 acres of brush and pine forest north of the port city of Marseille, damaging houses and injuring at least three people.French authorities said Thursday morning that the fires had either been put out or were under control, including near the town of Fos-sur-Mer, which has a concentration of oil and petrochemical facilities.But the authorities also cautioned that the risk of fires picking up again was high because of strong winds and dry vegetation.Four firefighters were wounded in the department of Hérault, west of Marseille, where a separate series of blazes was brought under control Wednesday evening.Near Marseille, 500 people were evacuated, mainly from the town of Vitrolles, but the local authorities allowed them to return to their homes Thursday. Highways near the fires were still closed Thursday morning, and air traffic at the Marseille airport, just west of Vitrolles, was still disrupted.
