New York Times reporters and editors are highlighting great stories from around the web. You can receive What We’re reading by email, and let us know how you like it at wwr@nytimes.com.From China Heritage: In a personal essay, an old friend of Liu Xiaobo reflects on the Nobel Peace laureate’s fate. He quotes a passage written by Mr. Liu: “Tyranny is not terrifying; what is really scary is submission, silence, and even praise for tyranny.” — Patrick Boehler, briefings team_____From The New York Review of Books: A screening of “Notes on Blindness” — a brilliant film, available on Netflix — sent me in search of more work by the film’s main subject, John Hull, a theologian who documented his descent into blindness. The first thing I found was a 1991 review by Oliver Sacks of Mr. Hull’s book “Touching the Rock.” I hardly needed more encouragement to track down a copy, but Mr. Sacks provided it nonetheless — and reminded me of how much I miss his New York Times Op-Eds. — Stephen Hiltner, staff editor_____From The New York Times: Today, you get two installments of my partisan writing roundup. First, read how the left, right and center are thinking about the fate of the Republicans’ health care bill. Then, click here to catch up on how writers from across ideologies reacted to President Trump’s trip to the G-20 summit meeting. — Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist_____From The Spectator: Trust in the media is declining in many parts of the world. In this short essay, the editor of one of Britain’s premier current affairs television programs looks at why, and what can be done about it. — Prashant Rao, deputy Europe business editor_____From Messy Nessy Chic: This ode to the women who dared break the Wimbledon dress code long before the Williams sisters is both amusing and historically informative. And, in a time when the issue of “appropriate” dress is much in the news, resonant far beyond the court. — Vanessa Friedman, fashion director_____From BuzzFeed: How music interacts with our life is a complicated but universal subject. Isaac Fitzgerald, the books editor at Buzzfeed (and a friend), tackles it all — the tragedies, the humor, the emotion — in this memoir of his relationship with The Hold Steady. “I’ve grown up with Craig Finn’s voice in my ears,” he writes about the band’s lead singer and songwriter. “I’m pretty sure I know where his albums end and my life begins, but I’m grateful that he so often blurs the line.” — Dan Saltzstein, assistant editor, Travel_____From McSweeney’s: Being a superhero often come with a lot of emotional baggage (exploding planets, dead relatives, etc.). This satirical letter from a father (on limited time) to his son (a future superhero) pokes delightful fun at many comic book conceits. — George Gustines, senior editor, Video/Graphics_____From The Times archives: With the heat comes the anxiety-causing quest for a new bathing suit. The bikini debuted in Paris in 1946, but only in 1966 did The Times declare it the summer to take the bikini plunge. For those women worried that the a two-piece was unsuitable for them, bikini designer Joana Franklin had words of encouragement: “All this business about it being only for skinny figures is silly. The bikini looks best on a woman with curves.” — Jennifer Parrucci, senior taxonomist_____
