A duplex penthouse at the pinnacle of One57, the vitreous skyscraper with nonpareil vistas of Central Park, the Hudson and East Rivers and almost every landmark on the horizon, sold for $100,471,452.77 to a mystery buyer, shattering the record for the highest price ever paid for a single residence in New York City, and was the most expensive sale of the week, according to city records.While the One57 duplex penthouse was the first to break the elusive $100 million barrier in New York City, it was certainly not the first in the United States. Last year, at least three estates sold for more than $100 million, including the most expensive residence in the country: an 18-acre property in East Hampton on Long Island that sold to Barry Rosenstein, a hedge fund manager, for $147 million.The monthly carrying costs for unit No. 90, on the 89th and 90th floors of the 90-story condominium at 157 West 57th Street, were estimated to be around $21,950, according to the offering plan, a discounted figure that includes a tax abatement negotiated by the sponsor, the Extell Development Company.Extell had initially marketed the 10,923-square-foot apartment for $98.5 million, then upped the asking price to $115 million, according to the state attorney general’s office.The higher and bolder price came as demand has increased for luxury apartments in Manhattan, especially among deep-pocketed foreign buyers, and followed the 2012 sale of a penthouse at 15 Central Park West for $88 million — the previous record-holder for a single-residence transaction in the city. A trust benefiting the daughter of a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, had bought the penthouse from the former Citigroup chairman Sanford I. Weill.Another duplex at One57, on the 75th and 76th floors, meanwhile, is reportedly under contract for more than $90 million; that deal has yet to be recorded in public records.The identity of the buyer of No. 90 at One57 was shielded by an aptly named limited liability company, P89-90; the Extell Marketing Group handled the transaction for the sponsor.Citing a strict confidentiality agreement with the buyer, Extell would not comment on any aspect of the deal, which city records showed closed on Dec. 23, even declining to disclose specifics about the apartment like the current number of bedrooms, bathrooms or floor plans and finishes.The original offering plan, however, put the number of bedrooms and bathrooms each at six, with two additional powder rooms. The plans also showed a reception gallery and grand salon, along with a formal dining room on the lower floor and an enormous, 19-by-29-foot master suite.The newest resident at the top of One57 will get to marvel at the unprecedented park, water and cityscape views from every room in the apartment, and will have access to in-room dining and spa services, a swimming pool and myriad other white-glove amenities available from the Park Hyatt New York hotel at the base of the brash blue building, which was designed by Atelier Christian de Portzamparc, the Pritzker-winning French firm.About 80 percent of the 94 apartments at One57 have sold since sales began in 2011, according to Ashley Murphy, a spokeswoman for Extell.Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.
