After a series of blockbuster quarters, profit at the Blackstone Group has slowed. But even in a quarter with weaker results, Wall Street’s biggest private equity company is larger than ever as the total money it manages has swelled to $333 billion.Blackstone reported on Thursday that profit in the second quarter — which includes gains that have not been realized — fell 62 percent, to $508 million, from the same period a year earlier.The private equity company, whose investments span the world and industries, blamed weak global equity markets for some of the drag on its earnings. A market rout in China and Greece’s debt crisis have worried market participants in recent weeks, pushing down the value of many of Blackstone’s publicly held businesses.After Blackstone’s first quarter, when profit rose to a record-breaking $1.6 billion, analysts pared back their expectations for the company. The second-quarter earnings, which amounted to 43 cents a share, matched analysts’ average estimates as surveyed by Thomson Reuters. (On Thursday, Thomson Reuters cut its estimate from an earlier report of 47 cents a share.)But Blackstone still notched a record for the quarter. The private equity giant’s distributable earnings — a measure that reflects the earnings it has realized and can give to shareholders — rose 35 percent, to $1 billion, from $765 million in the second quarter of last year. The company’s performance fees, earned from making profit on investments, were a big driver of the gain.“We produced solid results for our investors in the second quarter with strong realization activity despite challenging market conditions,” Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of Blackstone, said in a statement.More striking are the vast sums of money that Blackstone continues to raise from investors like pension funds as these investors seek better returns during a period of low interest rates in the United States. Blackstone now oversees $332.7 billion in private equity, hedge funds, fixed income and real estate, a 7 percent gain from the first quarter of this year.Over the last 12 months, Blackstone has raised $94 billion, a record for the company and the industry. Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, the Blackstone president, Hamilton E. James, said it was a good environment for raising money.Private equity funds (including Blackstone) have returned cash to investors recently. This, coupled with the fact that many of these investors are still moving their money into higher growth investments, has meant that “they’ve got to run a little faster to stay on the treadmill,” Mr. James said.“There is a lot of money out there looking for decent returns,” Mr. James added.In the second quarter, Blackstone’s real estate unit, led by Jonathan D. Gray, raised $1.9 billion from investors, adding to the $15.8 billion it raised in March for a new global flagship real estate fund. The real estate arm — with a portfolio of $91.6 billion of assets — is one of Blackstone’s engines for growth, making money by buying cheap commercial property in Europe. It has also become the largest buyer of single-family homes in the United States.In April, Blackstone bought Chicago’s Willis Tower (once known as the Sears Tower) for $1.3 billion and said it planned to invest more than $150 million in the building, one of the tallest in the United States.The hedge fund and credit arms of Blackstone reported higher net income from the same period a year ago, but its private equity and real estate businesses fell. Revenue at its financial advisory unit, which Blackstone is spinning off, also fell.Blackstone’s portfolio of publicly listed companies was buffeted by weakness in global markets. Some of the stakes it owns in public companies in industries like travel and property dropped by double digits.Blackstone said it now had $82.1 billion in “dry powder,” an industry term for the amount of capital it has available to spend on new investments. Within its private equity arm, the company is looking to deploy much of its deep pool of capital overseas, where it sees more opportunities.Shareholders will receive a dividend of 74 cents a share for the quarter, up 35 percent from last year. Shares of Blackstone rose 1.5 percent to close at $41.96 on Thursday.
