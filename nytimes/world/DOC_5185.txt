SEOUL, South Korea — Fifty-two crew members remained missing in the western Bering Sea after their South Korean trawler sank in the frigid water on Monday, government and company officials said.Rescuers had managed to pull seven survivors and one dead crew member from the water after the 1,753-ton trawler Oryong 501 sank off the coast of the Chukotka region in northeast Russia, the officials said. Other fishing boats rushed to the scene, but strong winds and rough seas hampered the rescue operation, they said.The South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said 60 people had been on board the 36-year-old ship: 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian inspector.The crew member found dead was a South Korean, a ministry official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the government had not yet made a formal announcement. The Russian, one Filipino and five Indonesians were rescued, said Sajo Industries, the South Korean company that operated the ship.The ship was believed to have run into trouble when a wave hit as the crew was hauling in its catch, flooding the boat’s storage chambers with seawater, said Lim Chae-ok, an executive at Sajo Industries.Those who were rescued were in a life raft, he said.Others were believed to have jumped into the sea with life jackets on, Mr. Lim said.The ship left for the Bering Sea from a port in Busan, South Korea, in July. It was one of six South Korean trawlers allowed to catch a total of 40,000 tons of pollock this year under a fisheries deal with Russia.Pollock is one of the most popular fish species in South Korea. After overfishing depleted its stock in waters near South Korea, the country has relied on fishing in the Bering Sea.
