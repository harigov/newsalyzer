Two groups of women have benefited from China’s economic reforms, feminists agree: country women who left the farm to work in the cities, escaping harsh patriarchal norms; and single girls in urban families, the product of China’s one-child policy, whose families are heaping on them the kind of investment once reserved for boys.Zhu Chunhong, Zan Xiaojing and Zhao Pengxiao embody that.Ms. Zhu, 39, from Baoding, Hebei Province, came to Beijing in 1990 and found work at a garment factory earning 120 renminbi a month, or $19. She met her future husband there.Today the couple run a farm in Changping County, part of Beijing Municipality, growing dragon fruit, with an annual income of 60,000 renminbi, she says.“At the factory we both earned 120 renminbi a month,” she said. “I think men and women in China today are very equal. Whatever difficulties you meet, it’s usually because you don’t work hard enough.”Sitting behind the wheel of a recently bought black sedan, Ms. Zan veers uncertainly into the courtyard of the Practical Skills Training Center for Rural Women, in Beijing’s outskirts. She hops out with her daughter, Ms. Zhao, saying they do not have much time to talk. There’s work to do at the family’s mushroom farm.“Men are people. Women are people too,” she says. “I really think we have equality today.”Ms. Zhao is just 19. Her mother looks on approvingly as Ms. Zhao explains that as a member of the “post-’90s” generation, born after 1990, she feels perfectly equal to men.“Boys my age wouldn’t tell me to shut up,” said Ms. Zhao, cheeks pink underneath long black bangs.“If you’re the kind of woman who works hard for your opportunities, you’re equal,” she said. “Of course, if you’re the kind that sits around, you may have problems.”
