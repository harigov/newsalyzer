KABUL — Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a powerful Afghan warlord who fought the Taliban and was supported by the American government after the invasion of Afghanistan, said in an online column published  Friday that it was “unimaginable” that forces allied with him could have killed Taliban prisoners in 2001 “to the extent that has been claimed.”General Dostum, recently reinstated to a senior position in the Afghan government and an important political ally of President Hamid Karzai, was responding to an article published in The New York Times on July 11.The article reported that Bush administration officials repeatedly discouraged efforts to investigate the killings of hundreds or even thousands of Taliban prisoners of war by forces allied with General Dostum when his organization was part of the American-backed Northern Alliance fighting the Taliban.In a column on the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Web site, General Dostum  wrote that the Northern Alliance had investigated and determined that there was no “intentional massacre” of prisoners of war.“I had given very clear orders for all of our troops in the Northern United Front to treat prisoners well,” General Dostum wrote. He added: “The massacre of prisoners of war to the extent that has been claimed is against the principles of intelligence gathering and security. From a military point of view, it is unimaginable.”The column drew sharp criticism from human rights groups who have investigated the mass deaths. Physicians for Human Rights, the Boston group that in 2002 discovered the site of the mass grave where the prisoners’ bodies were said to have been buried, accused General Dostum of trying to distract from the “substantial documentation” of the mass deaths.The group described “clear indications of evidence tampering” at the mass grave site and said that at least four witnesses had been killed, tortured, or had disappeared. The group called for a full investigation into both the mass deaths and evidence the Bush administration squelched efforts to investigate the episode.The Times article emphasized that accounts of the killings had been previously reported. The mass deaths occurred in November 2001, after thousands of Taliban fighters surrendered to General Dostum’s forces in Kunduz and were transported to a prison run by his forces near Shibarghan.Survivors and witnesses later told The Times and Newsweek that prisoners were stuffed into closed metal shipping containers and suffocated, or were killed when guards shot into the containers.The focus of The Times article was  new revelations that even though officials from the F.B.I., the State Department, the Red Cross and human rights groups sought an investigation, Bush administration officials discouraged the inquiry because General Dostum worked closely with the C.I.A. and American Special Operations forces and was a member of Mr. Karzai’s American-backed government.After The Times article was published, President Obama told CNN that “the indications that this had not been properly investigated just recently was brought to my attention.” Mr. Obama also said he had asked his national security team to “collect the facts for me that are known, and we’ll probably make a decision in terms of how to approach it once we have all of the facts gathered up.”The Times had sought comment from General Dostum through a spokesman for his party in Afghanistan, but the spokesman declined to comment on the mass deaths, and instead recommended trying to reach the general through an intermediary.  Unable to reach General Dostum, The Times cited his prior statements that any deaths were unintentional and that only 200 prisoners had died, mostly from combat wounds and disease.Officials at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is financed by Congress through the Broadcasting Board of Governors, said that General Dostum’s column was sent to them and other news outlets unsolicited, and that they translated it from Dari into English.  The organization decided to solicit a rebuttal to run alongside the column, which ended up “more or less refuting it,” said Jay Tolson, the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty newsroom director in Prague.“Dostum’s version, while highly questionable to say the least, was interesting, but we didn’t want to run it without a very informed counterpoint by somebody who was on the scene,” Mr. Tolson said.The rebuttal published on the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Web site stated that the “facts currently available indicate very strongly that many detainees — possibly hundreds — died while in the custody of Dostum’s forces in November 2001 and their bodies were dumped in the nearby desert of Dasht-i-Leili.” It was written by Sam Zarifi, a human rights investigator in northwestern Afghanistan in 2002 who is now the Asia-Pacific director for Amnesty International.
