BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia’s Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, who was governor of Riyadh for nearly 50 years until his recent promotion to Saudi Arabia’s defense minister, was officially named crown prince on Monday, making him the heir apparent to the 88-year-old King Abdullah.The promotion of Prince Salman, 76, to Crown Prince Salman, announced via royal decree broadcast on Saudi state television, had been expected following the sudden death on Saturday of Crown Prince Nayef bin Albdulaziz al-Saud. The selection was considered a natural choice because of Prince Salman’s reputation as an austere, hard-working family disciplinarian whose tasks included controlling the special jail for princes run amok. He will keep his job as defense minister.The royal decree also said Crown Prince Salman’s younger full brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the deputy interior minister, had been promoted to interior minister, a post that Crown Prince Nayef had also held.Despite the speedy promotions, which carried no surprises, the sudden death off Crown Prince Nayef, who was buried on Sunday, has scrambled the complicated jigsaw puzzle of family rule in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter. King Abdullah, though ailing, remains at the helm. While he has loosened some aspects of public dialogue, most Saudis expect only glacial change. In confronting Arab Spring ferment elsewhere in the Middle East, the Saudis successfully bought at least temporary social peace last year when they announced a $130 billion public welfare program.“In the short run you are surrounded by revolutions all over and the Iranian threat, so the same policies will continue,” said Mahmoud Sabbagh, a young commentator. “I don’t think we will witness anything unexpected.”Nonetheless, Crown Prince Nayef’s death brings closer the day of reckoning when the Saudis will have to figure out how to move to the third generation of princes, the grandsons of King Abdulaziz al-Saud, who founded the kingdom in 1932.Estimates of the number of princes of the ruling clan run to more than 7,000, but critical decisions have always been tightly held among the top three or four, including the ministers of defense and the interior, who have always been sons of King Abdulaziz. Now that Prince Salman has been named crown prince, most Saudi analysts say that just two younger sons of King Abdulaziz are considered by the family to be monarch material — possessing the needed blend of shrewdness, government experience and rectitude. The roughly 10 other surviving sons are marred by ill health, a lack of ability, a whiff or worse of corruption, or a reputation for practices that violate the tenets of Islam, like drinking alcohol.Two other potential heirs are Prince Ahmed, believed to be 71, and Prince Muqrin, in his 60s.Prince Ahmed had been the deputy interior minister since 1975, and his promotion to interior minister makes him the kingdom’s law enforcement czar. Prince Muqrin is the head of intelligence, but one stumbling block may be that his mother was reportedly a Yemeni, and many members of the royal family are sticklers for pure Saudi genealogy.The Saudis are also sticklers for deferring to age. There are grandsons of King Abdulaziz with extensive government experience who are barely older than his youngest sons, and it is not clear if age or patrilineage will be the primary factor in deciding succession. One of those slightly older, experienced grandsons is Prince Khaled al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca.In 2006 King Abdullah created the Allegiance Council, which is made up of approximately 34 princes — one representative for each son of King Abdulaziz. It was supposed to decide the succession question, but King Abdullah exempted himself, and it has never been activated.That prompted unusual public grumbling by some members, notably by Prince Talal, who considers himself king material despite a renegade period in the early 1960s.One thing is certain: succession questions are decided behind palace doors, with no public participation.The choice of Prince Salman at least delayed any generational change. He is said to suffer from non-life-threatening back ailments, but in recent years many senior princes have become stooped. The sight of King Abdullah and his closest brothers all in a line and bent over on wobbling canes brings into clear focus what a gerontocracy the kingdom has become.Prince Salman took over the Defense Ministry in November upon the death of his full brother Prince Sultan, after supervising Riyadh’s growth from a minor town of around 200,000 people to a sprawling metropolis of more than 5.5 million.Other Saudi cities have faltered in their development — Jidda, the commercial capital, notoriously lacks a sewage system, for example. But Prince Salman created a Riyadh development authority with a representative from each ministry to cut through the red tape.The prince is variously described as disciplined, active, austere, sober and traditional but not hard-line. He is considered generally popular with the family and the public, and has traveled abroad widely.Saudi analysts peg him as a “moderate conservative” with ties to all the competing factions within the country, from strict Islamists to liberal intellectuals pushing for political change.
