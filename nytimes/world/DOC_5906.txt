The New York Times Company will invest more than $50 million over the next three years to support an ambitious plan to expand its international digital audience and increase revenue outside the United States, the company said on Thursday. The Times has formed a new team, NYT Global, to lead the effort.“Because our digital report is still designed and produced mainly for a U.S. audience, we have not come close to realizing our potential to attract readers outside our home market,” Arthur Sulzberger Jr., The Times’s publisher; Mark Thompson, its chief executive; and Dean Baquet, its executive editor, wrote in a memo to employees. About the $50 million investment, they said: “We are confident this will be a down payment on a new era of international growth for our company.”Joe Kahn, an assistant masthead editor for international, will lead NYT Global’s editorial strategy alongside Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, the international president, who will oversee the business operations. Lydia Polgreen, deputy international editor, will become an associate masthead editor and editorial director for NYT Global.Just as The Times pushed beyond its local boundaries to become a national newspaper in the 1990s, the executives said in the memo that they now saw the “ opportunity to become an indispensable leader in global news and opinion” by expanding its presence outside the country’s borders.The Times outlined a strategy in October to double its digital revenue to $800 million by 2020, from $400 million in 2014. The company was “setting even more ambitious targets for our international growth,” according to the memo.
