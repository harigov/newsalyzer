What’s for Dinner? answers that universal question, offering recipes for simple, relatively quick dishes that use ingredients you can pick up on the way home.It doesn’t really matter what you dip into Thai peanut sauce. Chicken, beef, carrot sticks, even fingers will all do fine as vehicles to bring the sweet and spicy sauce from bowl to mouth.That said, I am partial to shrimp. Shrimp is lean enough to make dinner feel virtuous even though you’re slathering everything with a rich and luscious sauce. And shrimp’s bright saline flavor works well with the deep, toasted character of the peanuts.In this recipe, I thread shrimp and pineapple chunks on skewers and broil them before serving. The skewers serve two purposes: They make the shrimp and pineapple easier to turn so you can broil broth sides. And they also make a nice satay-style presentation. But if you don’t have skewers, just place everything out in one layer on your baking sheet and use a spatula to do the flipping.The peanut sauce itself comes together quickly in the blender. Taste it and adjust the seasonings to your liking, adding more ginger, hot sauce or lime juice as you see fit.And if you have any sauce left, save it for future meals and snacks. From leftover roast chicken, to a bowl of crisp salad greens (try cabbage or Romaine), or even just spooned on a cut- up apple, Thai peanut sauce goes with almost anything.Recipe: Shrimp and Pineapple Skewers With Peanut Sauce
