In 2013 the filmmakers Josie Swantek Heitz and Dave Adams arrived in Thailand, expecting to investigate the country’s sex trade and the practice of poor families who sell off their daughters, some as young as 9 or 10, to human traffickers.Their guide would be a crusader against such horrors: Mickey Choothesa, who had founded a nongovernmental organization, the Children’s Organization of Southeast Asia (COSA), and had, he said, personally rescued girls from brothels, raising them in a dorm environment and making sure that they were fed and clothed and attended school.As “The Wrong Light” documents, the inquiry veers in another direction. It’s no spoiler to say that the filmmakers start to believe that the organization is based on a fraud: The very first scene is of Ms. Heitz, stepping out of an interview with a parent who was said to have made such a sale — her first without Mr. Choothesa interpreting. Almost in a daze, she murmurs, “It’s all a big lie.”The film’s first half chronicles the events leading to that interview; the girls who live at the organization and go to school in Chiang Mai are bright and motivated, and glad for the opportunities their families in the hill tribes of Northern Thailand lack. But they later burst into tears when they hear how they and their families have been presented in materials to donor groups — put, as one says, in “the wrong light.”Even so, perhaps the families are denying the truth out of shame. The rest of the film tries to determine the facts, though questions remain. In the end, “The Wrong Light” is an engrossing cautionary tale teaching one of philanthropy’s oldest lessons: Caveat emptor.
