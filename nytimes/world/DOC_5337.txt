SEOUL, South Korea —  North Korea launched three short-range projectiles off its east coast on Saturday in an apparent test of its newly developed tactical missile, South Korean military officials said.The projectiles flew about 130 miles from Wonsan on North Korea’s east coast, landing harmlessly into the sea between North Korea and Japan, said officials at the Joint Chiefs of staff of South Korea.They said the launchings were believed to be part of North Korea’s efforts to test a new tactical missile with a range slightly longer than that of its KN-2 missile, which can fly just over 100 miles. North Korea was also believed to have fired the new missile in a launching last month and another test on Monday.After firing five missiles in the test last month, North Korea said it successfully tested a newly developed tactical missile.North Korea has conducted an unusually frequent series of short-range missile and rocket tests this year. The South Korean military estimated that the North fired more than 110 projectiles, mostly short-range versions, in 19 rounds of tests since January.North Korea has often fired missiles to raise tensions, hoping that such actions would force the United States and South Korea to engage it in dialogue. But military analysts have said that the North’s recent tests were also designed to extend the ranges of its short-range rockets and missiles and increase its threats to hit the United States military in South Korea, which has been regrouping some of its units in South Korea away from the border with the North and keeps its main air bases south of Seoul.
