The competition to give cord-cutters a less expensive replacement for cable that satisfies live television needs increased on Wednesday as Hulu entered the crowded field.Hulu, the streaming video company, announced that Hulu Live would join products like DirecTV Now, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV in trying to appeal to people who want live television but do not want to pay more than $100 a month for large cable bundles. The services offer smaller bundles of channels and allow viewers to watch live television outside the home on mobile devices. Because the video is delivered over the internet, consumers do not need to buy bulky hardware.But choosing a service can be overwhelming. Each lacks channels or features that some viewers consider essential.Here are questions to ask when considering the services:If you live alone, this may not be a concern. But for families with more than one child, or for apartment dwellers with roommates, being able to watch on only two screens at once may not cut it.Several of the services offer packages with different channel lineups and prices. If a specific channel is a must, make sure the package you are considering includes it.You may be able to patch gaps by buying stand-alone services like CBS and HBO. To enjoy the services on bigger screens, you will need a device like an Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire Stick or Google Chromecast.All of the services offer the basics for sports fans, including ESPN, ESPN2, FS1 and FS2. But the availability of regional sports networks, or the channels that frequently show Major League Baseball, N.B.A. and N.H.L. games, varies by market. Check the service’s website to see what is included. You will also need to check on the availability of channels that occasionally feature live sports, like TNT, NFL Network, NBA TV, Big Ten Network and SEC Network.Subscribers would gain access to its streaming library, which otherwise costs $7.99 a month.Price: $39.99 (barely making good on the chief executive’s promise that it would be under $40).Channels: More than 50, varying by area.DVR: 50 hours of storage space included; can expand to 200 hours of storage for $14.99.HBO/Showtime: Showtime can be added for $9.How many screens?
