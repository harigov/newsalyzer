YOU’RE skiing slowly on an intermediate trail and you suddenly slip. You’re not out of control — you weren’t going that fast — but you are off balance. One arm flails behind your head as you teeter and twist backward until your hips awkwardly sit down on  the tails of your skis.Then you hear a loud pop in your knee. You probably have just torn the anterior cruciate ligament, which in the last 20 years has become the most common serious injury in skiing, dwarfing the number of broken legs. You face major reconstructive surgery and at least six months of grueling rehabilitation.And it is in the kind of fall just described — a clumsy, sometimes slow sit-down or backward fall — that  roughly 70 percent of skiers’ A.C.L. tears occur, experts on ski safety estimate. It’s called the “phantom foot” phenomenon, where the tail of the ski,  which acts like an alternate  (or “phantom”)  foot, combined with the stiff back of a ski boot, functions as a lever to apply a singular blend of twisting and bending weight loads to the knee. The centrally located anterior cruciate ligament, which connects the femur and tibia bones and helps stabilize the knee, can’t handle the stress.Skiing over all is safer than it has ever been, with injuries on the slopes declining by 55 percent since 1972, according to statistics compiled by Carl Ettlinger of the University of Vermont. He and his colleagues Drs. Robert Johnson and Jasper Shealy have been studying ski injuries and identified the phantom foot.The injury reduction is largely due to improvements in boots and bindings. Once, broken legs below the knee were the primary scourge of the skier. But more efficient ski bindings and the modern plastic boot that rises almost to the knee have made lower leg fractures almost uncommon.A.C.L. tears, however, soared by 103 percent from 1972 to 2006, according to the study of more than 18,000 ski injuries at the Sugarbush Resort in Vermont done by Mr. Ettlinger and Drs. Johnson and Shealy.  Most of that increase came during the early years of their study, from 1972 until the early 1990s, and things have gotten a little better since.Still, the number of skiing-related A.C.L. injuries annually is estimated at 20,000 and may cost Americans up to $250 million a year.“The focal point in ski safety study is the A.C.L.,” said Mr. Ettlinger, an adjunct assistant professor in orthopedics and rehabilitation at the University of Vermont Medical School.Not surprisingly, a lot of people have tried to solve the problem. Mr. Ettlinger, for example, produced and distributed about three million pamphlets to ski areas and ski shops that outlined knee-friendly skiing tips.Here are his key suggestions:   Keep your arms forward with hands over toes and hips above knees.  Never reach back with your hand in a fall.   Once you have fallen, don’t try to get up until you’ve stopped sliding.A typical backward fall occurs after a jump, something more and more people are trying in terrain parks. Mr. Ettlinger cautions against jumping before learning how to land properly, which means landing on both skis at the same time with knees flexed and arms forward.His knee-friendly techniques were taught to ski patrollers and instructors at 20 ski areas for three years, and Mr. Ettlinger’s research group noted a 50 percent reduction in serious A.C.L. tears.Others have tried to combat the anterior cruciate ligament problem by redesigning the ski binding; Mr. Ettlinger himself has a patent pending on a new binding. And last week, a new device called the KneeBinding was shipped to certain ski stores. While standard bindings release laterally at the toe or pull up and forward at the heel, the KneeBinding adds a lateral heel release as a third dimension.“This binding senses and reacts to the signature load that occurs just before the A.C.L. tears,” said Rick Howell, a former college ski racer who invented the KneeBinding. “It cannot eliminate all A.C.L. tears, but it can reduce the biggest cause of them.”The binding, developed over five years, has undergone extensive testing in the international ski safety community. It has distinctive features, like a left and a right binding, Mr. Howell said, and won’t release when it shouldn’t. It also has definitely created a buzz in the ski world.“By allowing the binding to release during the type of fall with the most common mechanism for tearing the A.C.L., skiing may actually become a lot safer,” Dr. William Sterett, the head team physician for the United States Women’s Ski Team and a surgeon at the Steadman Hawkins Clinic in Vail, Colo., wrote in an e-mail message when asked about the KneeBinding. “The science behind the new binding is very solid, and we are anxious to see how it performs in  real skiers this coming year.”Dr. Bryan Huber, an orthopedic surgeon in Vermont who also works with the United States Ski and Snowboard team (and also has no business ties to the KneeBinding company), has studied the mechanics of the KneeBinding.“It’s different than any previous binding, and that’s exciting,” said Dr. Huber, who sees dozens of skiing A.C.L. tears each winter at his clinic near Stowe. “We’ve come to realize that the A.C.L. injury in skiers is more complex than we thought, and we probably need a more complex binding. This binding isn’t proven yet, but it has potential.”The first shipment of KneeBinding products — the company is based in Stowe — arrived in about 25 ski shops in a dozen states and a handful of European countries last weekend, according to the company’s majority owner, John Springer-Miller. The binding can be bought directly at www.kneebinding.com, and the Web site will help consumers find a retailer authorized to install and test the binding for use.With retail prices of $479 and $499, the KneeBinding is at the high end of the market, but as Chris Brown, a professor of mechanical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who has also studied the KneeBinding, said, “If it saves you from an A.C.L. tear, that’s a very inexpensive binding.”Mr. Brown, a former all-American ski racer, was part of a 1983 skiing research team that warned of anterior cruciate ligament tears. His oldest son, Roger, a member of the United States Ski team, sustained a career-ending A.C.L. injury last season.“It’s very frustrating to me that 25 years ago we saw something, but I couldn’t stop it from affecting my own household,” Mr. Brown said. “Still, I think we are getting somewhere in this. There’s a strong likelihood that this binding and other efforts will reduce certain kinds of A.C.L. injuries.”
