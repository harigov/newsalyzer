Stephon Marbury took a dip in the pool, played table tennis and hummed lyrics to music. He also offered his opinion over and over again.Marbury was uncensored and unfiltered Friday as he took to the Internet and tried to host a 24-hour live chat with viewers on the Web site Ustream.tv from his Los Angeles residence.For Marbury, the time served as an opportunity to bypass the news media, which he has regularly accused of misrepresenting him. Much of it, though, served as a reminder of Marbury’s erratic interview on “Mike’d Up” in the summer of 2007.Among Friday’s highlights:¶On leaving the Knicks: “My job wasn’t taken. It was given to Chris Duhon. Don’t get it twisted. And that’s no disrespect to Duhon either.”¶On philanthropy: “I’m going to set up a foundation for the world. I’m going to take the money and start building cities all over the world. I’m a comet. My man told me I’m a comet. I said, ‘I’m a comet?’ ”¶On Jeanie Buss, a Los Angeles Lakers executive: “Jeanie Buss, I love her with all my heart. I’d take my heart out and give it to her. That’s how ill she is. I love that lady.”¶On the best player in the N.B.A.: “No, I’m not the best player in the N.B.A. Kobe Bryant is the best player. I don’t care about the N.B.A. Those days are over with.”That was the CliffsNotes version. Many topics were covered, including Marbury’s  preference for Bugs Bunny over Mickey Mouse. Marbury is still a free agent after a cameo appearance with the Boston Celtics after his exile from the Knicks. He had more camera time Friday than he did all last season.
