Amazon’s Prime Day — the annual, summer version of an all-Amazon Cyber Monday — starts today. As with the last few years, most deals aren’t worth it, but there are a few gems sprinkled throughout. Subscribers to Amazon’s Prime service (which gets you two-day shipping on items and other perks for $99 yearly) have access to thousands of items on sale.Even though only a small percentage of those deals are truly worth it, and few of them are available unless you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can make the most of Prime Day with careful planning. For example, Lightning Deals, sales that last for a just a short period of time or last only until stock runs out, can offer steeper discounts than the daylong deals.Similarly, if you’re not an Amazon subscriber, consider signing up for the free trial to take advantage of the day’s discounts — in case you see something you like. (Just make sure to cancel before you’re automatically billed once the trial is over.) Amazon’s competitors, like Walmart and Best Buy, might also offer discounts on select products as a counter to Prime Day, too.Check out The Wirecutter (which is owned by The New York Times) to help you map out a Prime Day strategy, which will update throughout Prime Day to feature the best discounts on things you may actually want to buy.We’ve also highlighted a few of our favorites so far:• Expect steep discounts on the Amazon Echo, a voice-controlled smart home speaker that can answer questions and play music to control all of your internet-connected devices. If you pick one up, The Wirecutter has a great rundown of all the things you can do with it.• Look for a deal on Tile’s Slim Tiles, which, once stuck to the back of your phone, use Bluetooth to track your phone’s location and alert you when it’s getting too far from you.• The August Smart Lock, a keyless door lock for your home that uses your smartphone as the key, should also be available for much cheaper than the regular price.You can find complete and updating coverage of Prime Day on The Wirecutter.
