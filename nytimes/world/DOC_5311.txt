SEOUL, South Korea — Increased vehicle activity has been detected at North Korea’s rocket launch site near its northwestern border with China, which could be a sign of preparations for the launch Pyongyang said it would conduct this month, according to a United States website that monitors the North.The website, 38 North, which uses commercial satellite imagery to analyze North Korean activity at the Tongchang-ri launch site and other locations, said on Wednesday that more vehicles had been seen around the site’s Horizontal Processing Building, where the various stages of a rocket are received.“Once received, they are assembled in the horizontal position to test all connections, perform final testing of subsystems and prepare the stages for mounting on the launchpad,” said the report on 38 North, which is run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University.The satellite imagery cited by 38 North is from Monday, a day before North Korea told United Nations agencies that it planned to launch a rocket between Feb. 8 and Feb. 25 to put an earth-observation satellite into orbit.The United States and its allies have condemned North Korea’s rocket and satellite program, calling it a cover for developing technology for intercontinental ballistic missiles. Various United Nations resolutions bar the North from pursuing such technology.China, North Korea’s sole major ally, which has been reluctant to join Washington’s attempt to place tougher sanctions on Pyongyang, called on its neighbor to “act with discretion and refrain from any actions that might escalate tension on the Korean Peninsula.” Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, also urged the North to refrain from using ballistic missile technology.Intelligence officials have monitored the Tongchang-ri site more closely since North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test, which it claimed was of a hydrogen bomb, last month. But recent renovations at the launch site have made it easier to conceal activity there, analysts have said.An underground railway now leads directly to the launchpad, and rocket parts can be unloaded, assembled and moved to the gantry tower by rail in a covered mobile structure. In the satellite images from Monday, tarpaulins had been placed over the gantry tower, concealing any work that might be underway there.
