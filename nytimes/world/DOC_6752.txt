Fiat Chrysler is recalling almost 1.7 million Ram pickup trucks over airbag or steering problems, the automaker said on Thursday. Just two months ago, Fiat Chrysler was assessed $105 million in civil penalties to settle regulators’ accusations that it jeopardized public safety by failing to comply with federal laws in 23 other recalls.Of the three recall notices, the largest covers about a million vehicles in the United States in which a wiring harness in the steering column could short-circuit, causing the driver’s airbag to deploy without a crash. The automaker said it was aware of two reports of injuries related to the defect.The recalled models are the 2012-14 Ram 1500 as well as the heavy-duty Ram models often used as commercial vehicles. About 236,000 vehicles in Canada, 26,500 in Mexico and almost 24,000 outside North America are also being recalled.A second recall — for a steering problem — is needed because some components may have weak welds.“This may lead to separation, which may affect steering; capability remains, but with diminished response,” the automaker said. One accident, which the automaker characterized as minor, has been reported, but there were no injuries.Recalled models are all heavy-duty models, the 2013 Ram 3500 pickups, 2014 Ram 2500/3500 pickups and 3500 Chassis Cabs. About 157,000 vehicles are in the United States, 21,000 in Canada and 13,000 in Mexico.The final recall covers 188,000 2014 and 2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab pickups in the United States because of a problem with so-called air curtains, which are airbags mounted in the ceiling over the side windows. They are designed to offer head protection and also reduce the risk of an occupant’s being thrown out of the vehicle in an accident.In July, federal regulators testing the Ram discovered the air curtains might not deploy quickly enough to offer the protection required under federal regulations.The automaker said it was not aware of any injuries related to the problem.In June, Fiat Chrysler recalled about 843,000 Ram pickups because slamming the door too hard could deploy the air curtain.
