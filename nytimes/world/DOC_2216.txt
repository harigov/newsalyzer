DOHA, Qatar — Not long after the government-held city of Palmyra in central Syria fell to Islamic State fighters, the United States and Russia both scrambled warplanes on Wednesday to attack militant targets there.This was exactly the kind of scenario the Pentagon feared after Moscow sent fighter jets and troops to Syria in the summer of 2015 to bail out the beleaguered government of President Bashar al-Assad: Russian and American fighters streaking toward each other in Syrian air space, raising the danger of a midair catastrophe.But it is also why the two countries, despite their disputes over how to calm the Syrian civil war, as well as over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine, last year set up a special hotline to help prevent disasters in the air.And that is why Col. Daniel Manning was on the phone here early Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, who was at an air base in Latakia, Syria, for what has become a three-times-a-week call to head off, or “deconflict,” as the military says, any potential problems in the skies over Syria.“The stakes are very high on both sides for getting this right,” said Colonel Manning, 43, from Birmingham, Ala., who placed the call from a sprawling American air command center in the desert outside the Qatari capital.Colonel Manning is an unusual warrior-diplomat. A former A-10 attack plane pilot who flew combat missions in Afghanistan, Colonel Manning also previously served as the defense attaché in Kyrgyzstan, a small, independent former Soviet republic in Central Asia where Russian is spoken. He also spoke Russian with Afghan officers when he deployed to Afghanistan as an adviser.Colonel Manning said he began Wednesday’s call by greeting his counterpart in Russian. But for the rest of the seven-minute call, he said he spoke through an interpreter (as did the Russian on the other end) to avoid any misunderstandings or missed nuances.Talking over a black speaker phone in a nondescript office above the command center (where Colonel Manning’s day job is deputy director), the colonel was all business. No idle chitchat, even though Colonel Manning said he had developed a good rapport over the months with his Russian air force interlocutor 1,200 miles away.Colonel Manning said he told the Russian that American intelligence analysts believed Islamic State fighters had captured some Russian-made T-72 tanks and other heavy weaponry at a Syrian military base in Palmyra that could threaten coalition troops in the area.“As soon as the weather clears, we will begin striking equipment in Palmyra,” Colonel Manning said he told the Russian, giving him roughly an hour’s notice before American jets were to begin bombing.The Russian colonel replied that Russian warplanes would also attack Islamic State targets as soon as heavy thunderstorms passed, and he promised to relay the American attack plans to his superiors and call back with any updates, Colonel Manning said.Top American commanders and Colonel Manning insist that the United States never asks Russia’s permission to carry out its operations in Syria. They simply communicate their plans.“It’s not coordination, it’s not synchronization, it’s not collaboration. It is deconfliction,” Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the military’s Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, said in Washington last month. “It is about ensuring safety of flight.”Palmyra has a very different significance for the United States and Russia.Nine months ago, Syrian government forces drove fighters for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from the desert city, where the militants had terrorized residents and blown up irreplaceable ancient monuments. Losing Palmyra for a second time is a major symbolic and military blow for the Syrian government, which trumpeted its reconquest of the city in March, after 10 months of Islamic State rule.Russia, which had helped the Syrian government with air support and advisers, flew an orchestra to play a victory concert in Palmyra’s ancient amphitheater that month. The Russians also established a small base in the city, but residents said all Russian troops had pulled out in recent days as the militants approached.For the Americans, the Islamic State regaining a foothold in Palmyra poses a potential threat to American-trained Syrian rebels operating about 60 miles south of the city. The Islamic State has previously attacked the New Syrian Army opposition forces at its garrison at the al-Tanf crossing, where Iraq, Syria and Jordan meet.Senior American and Russian military officials held an unusual videoconference last June, days after the Russians dropped cluster bombs on the opposition fighters at the al-Tanf crossing, where Pentagon officials said the rebels were battling Islamic State militants.Incidents like that give American commanders pause about whether Russia will start flying more missions in eastern Syria — where American-led operations are focused against the Islamic militant group — once Russian-backed Syrian forces consolidate control over Aleppo.“It’s an area of concern that I’m tracking,” Lt. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, the air commander for Syria and Iraq, said in an interview on Wednesday.Later in the day, Colonel Manning said the Russian officer had called back to assure him that the Syrian tanks had been damaged in the recent fighting and posed no threat. Colonel Manning said his Russian counterpart had not misled him before, but that American analysts would review the targets again and decide for themselves whether to strike them.By late Wednesday, stormy weather had forced both American and Russian jets to postpone their strikes in Palmyra and divert their warplanes to other targets. Once the clouds clear — perhaps in the next 24 to 48 hours — and analysts double-check their surveillance photos, Colonel Manning said he could be on the phone again to the Russians with a warning to steer clear of the tanks.“If they belong to ISIS,” he said, “we will destroy them.”
