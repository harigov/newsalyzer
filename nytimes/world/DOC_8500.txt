TEHRAN —  As word made its way around the globe that an understanding had been reached with the United States and other powers to limit Iran’s nuclear program, Iranians themselves greeted the news with optimism and skepticism on Friday.While the political climate remained uncertain, the government was allowed to promote the deal at Friday Prayer, a sign that the plan was broadly supported by Iran’s establishment.In a nationally televised speech on Friday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, praised the deal as a development that “benefits everybody.”Answering some Western critics who question Tehran’s credibility, he pledged that his country would keep its end of the bargain. “Any promise that we made and any promise that we will make, we will stand by it,” he said. “We are not men of deception and hypocrisy.”Wading into an area that his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, conspicuously avoided in the negotiations this week in Switzerland, Mr. Rouhani portrayed the nuclear deal as an Iranian opening to the world.“It is not true to say that when the nuclear issue is over we will have nothing to do with the world,” he said, calling it a first step toward “constructive interaction with the world.”Some predicted that hard-liners, who mostly kept quiet during the negotiations, would now mobilize for a fight. But business leaders, in particular, were elated at the prospect that a deal could soon mean the lifting of long years of economic sanctions.“I jumped up and down of happiness,” Rouzbeh Pirouz said by telephone. An Oxford-educated investment fund manager, Mr. Pirouz, 43, received the news just after landing on the Mediterranean island of Majorca.“People in the terminal must have thought I was crazy,” he added.As details of the framework agreement were sifted here, however, the outlines of the deal was immediately criticized for what hard-liners called overly deep concessions by Iran.“We should say in a word that we gave a saddled horse and received a torn bridle,” the semiofficial news agency Fars quoted Hossein Shariatmadari, a vocal hard-liner who is editor in chief of the state newspaper Kayhan, as saying on Friday.After finding out that Iran would be allowed to have only about 5,000 centrifuges, according to a fact sheet released by the State Department, Alireza Mataji, a 26-year-old student who has been allowed to organize events critical of the negotiations, posted on Twitter: “We will have just enough centrifuges left to make carrot juice.”There was no reaction from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in recent weeks has emphasized that all Iranians should support the negotiations. But now that a framework has been reached, analysts said that he would allow those criticizing a deal — he might do so himself — to voice their opposition.“We can expect him to listen to all sides,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government of President Rouhani. “That means that we might even see hard-liners gaining more power in the coming months; on the other hand, it also might be different. We have to wait and see how this will play out.“No matter how we try to sugarcoat it,” Mr. Laylaz added, “this means we no longer will have an industrial-scale enrichment program. This is the price we have to pay for earlier mistakes.”Others also expressed disappointment about the terms for Iran and noted that the deal itself would do little to change the underlying differences with the United States.“According to the U.S. interpretation, significant concessions have been made, and sanctions will not be removed in the way many here were expecting,” said Mohammad Marandi, a professor of North American studies at Tehran University.Mr. Marandi, who has been critical of the United States government, pointed at the rise of Saudi- and Turkish-backed extremism in the Middle East and emphasized that under current circumstances there could be no normal relationship with Washington.“What we really want to see from the Americans is an end to their support of countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey who support extremist groups,” he said. “Make no mistake, the Middle East may soon explode, and we need a clear signal from the Americans to see where they stand.”At the important Friday Prayer session in Tehran, a bastion of hard-liners, there were the usual chants of “death to America,” but efforts were also made to push the nuclear negotiations to a wider audience.Mr. Rouhani’s first adviser took the stage to give the pre-sermon speech and lauded the agreements made in Lausanne, Switzerland, as good achievements.“Those who never wanted us to have the right to enrichment now agree we have that right,” said the adviser, Mohammad Nahavandian. “Those who opposed us having the full fuel cycle now no longer oppose. Instead of sanctions, they now speak of cooperation. We have not retreated. Those opposing this deal are enemies, in line with the Zionists.”Worshipers basking in the spring sun were also optimistic.“If it is in our national interest to make an understanding with the West, we should do it,” said Mohsen Abdollahi, a cleric in a white turban on his way to the V.I.P. section of the prayer hall at Tehran University. “We can even stop shouting ‘death to America’ if it is needed.”Still, most in Tehran seem first and foremost to be hoping for a revival of the economy once the sanctions are lifted. Being able again to sell oil to the European Union and to have restrictions on sales to Asia lifted by the United States could bring in much-needed cash for Mr. Rouhani’s government, Mr. Laylaz said.Iranians appear also to be hoping for the strengthening of their currency, which has plummeted since sanctions, including those blocking bank transactions, were intensified. There is also the prospect of around $100 billion in frozen funds returning to the country.“Still, I hope the government will be responsible and not start to inject all this cash into the economy, as inflation will skyrocket,” Mr. Laylaz said. He added that many of Iran’s economic problems were caused by mismanagement and corruption, not by sanctions.Mr. Pirouz, the fund manager, had long ago bet on Iran to open up. It seemed, he said, that the moment was now very near.His inbox was overflowing with messages of congratulations from well-known international funds that over the past year had shown interest in investing in Iran, he said.“There now is the potential of lots of foreign investment coming into the country,” said Mr. Pirouz, whose company, Turquoise Partners, is helping investors find their way into the Tehran Stock Exchange. “These are very exciting times.”
