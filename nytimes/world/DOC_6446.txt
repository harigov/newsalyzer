This description of airline security is offered lightly and quickly, as a deadpan joke, but the observation is surprisingly deep.Living in the modern world means passing, with some frequency, through such bureaucratic nonplaces: waiting rooms, security checks, government offices. Inside, we are compelled to perform strange rituals. We submit fingerprints, recite Social Security numbers, put on paper gowns. It really does feel, in a sense, like dying. We find ourselves reduced and distilled and assessed; our most invisible attributes (bones, retinas, blood types, histories) become visible; some higher power determines whether we are worthy of the favor we are hoping will be conferred. These little deaths are part of the grand bargain of living in a civilization. In return for them, we get protection, irrigation, transportation, arbitration.And yet, inevitably, there is that tiny moment of uncertainty. You enter the body scanner and hold your hands over your head, and in that instant you have to trust that you will be resurrected — will be allowed to walk out of the security area or drive away from the checkpoint. This trust is a great luxury: the reward for being a valued citizen of a stable state. Like other luxuries, it is not equally distributed, nor is it guaranteed. Systems can become unstable. Your status can suddenly change. And moments of metaphorical death can turn literal.
