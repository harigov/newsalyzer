What’s for Dinner? answers that universal question, offering recipes for simple, relatively quick dishes that use ingredients you can pick up on the way home.Sausages have no season, which is a lucky thing because I crave them all year long. They are as good served with potatoes and cabbage in the dead of winter as they are grilled in the summer, with ripe tomatoes and basil on the side.In this recipe, I’ve dressed up pan-seared sausages for spring with sautéed Swiss chard and slices of rhubarb. The rhubarb falls apart as it cooks, adding a bracing, tart note that cuts the oily richness of the sausage and brightens the earthiness of the greens. Red Swiss chard is my first choice here both for the color of its stems and for its mineral flavor. But kale, particularly Tuscan kale, or watercress are fine substitutes.Use any kind of sausage you like in this recipe. I generally go for pork or lamb, but turkey or duck sausage would work just as well.Then, all you’ll need is some kind of starch to round out this meal -- polenta, farro, rice or even just a crusty loaf of bread. Of course, a glass of wine wouldn’t hurt either. Make mine a rosé to kick off spring.Recipe: Sausage With Chard and Rhubarb
