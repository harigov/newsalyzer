MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — The scientific detective work that forced Volkswagen into a $15 billion settlement began with a handful of researchers armed with just $70,000.For years, the research team at West Virginia University, which first noticed big discrepancies in Volkswagen’s diesel emissions, has scrounged for grants and research funding to survive. Only a fraction of its $1.5 million annual budget comes from the university, and that is being cut.“I still have sleepless nights trying to figure out how I’m going to pay the guys the next pay cycle,” said Dan Carder, director of the university’s Center for Alternative Fuels Engines and Emissions.The success of Mr. Carder’s David against Volkswagen’s Goliath illustrates the huge disparity in resources between carmakers and oversight groups. The road testing technology that exposed Volkswagen to a raft of criminal investigations and lawsuits never attracted much interest — or money — from regulators or carmakers until recently, and that is still not certain to relieve the group‘s financial pressure.Since the deception came to light last year, Mr. Carder, 46, has achieved a degree of celebrity not usually accorded to vehicle emissions experts. Time magazine named him to its annual list of the world’s 100 most influential people, alongside Nicki Minaj, Vladimir Putin and Pope Francis.But fame does not necessarily equal riches, or even stability, in the world of academia.The agreement between Volkswagen and federal and state governments includes $4.7 billion for research into clean transportation and projects to offset the emissions from about 500,000 Volkswagen diesel engines that are polluting more than the law allows.At best, Mr. Carder hopes to claim a sliver of that research money for the testing center in this hilly region cut by the Monongahela River. Or he could land contracts to verify the effectiveness of repairs that Volkswagen plans to make on cars with excess emissions.Every little bit of funding helps.The center he runs received $70,000 in 2013 from an environmental group, the International Council on Clean Transportation, to conduct the study that eventually exposed how Volkswagen had rigged vehicles to deceive regulators. The original purpose of the research was to show that carmakers were capable of meeting more rigorous limits on emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides. The work was more complicated than expected, though, and Mr. Carder had to make up a $20,000 or $30,000 shortfall from other sources.Those who have pushed emissions testing forward tend to be mavericks, like Leo Breton.While working as an engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency in 1995, Mr. Breton cobbled together a prototype for a portable emissions measurement system. Because he had no official budget for the project, he borrowed parts he needed or adapted them from equipment in E.P.A. labs.The work helped expose cheating cases and also led to several patents that the agency licensed to equipment manufacturers. Mr. Carder calls Mr. Breton the “grandfather” of mobile emissions testing. West Virginia researchers built on his work when testing highway emissions for trucks in 1999.Despite such successes, the E.P.A. and other regulators have continued to rely on laboratory tests to check auto emissions. Volkswagen took advantage of that practice, programming its diesel vehicles to increase their control of pollution when the engine software detected that the car was running on rollers in a lab.Otherwise, emissions equipment in Volkswagen diesels was deployed sparingly to protect components or save fuel. Volkswagen has admitted in court documents that it never expected anyone to test its cars on the road, where the illegal software would not work.Part of the difficulty is that measuring the emissions of a moving vehicle is a significant engineering challenge.Mr. Carder and his team drew on their experience testing trucks when they got the contract to test cars in 2013. One challenge was to fit what amounts to a mobile laboratory in the car. At the time, the equipment available for such emissions testing had enough battery power only for short trips.To make long hauls possible, the West Virginia University researchers bought portable gasoline generators at regular hardware stores and bolted them to the rear ends of the test cars. The generators made a terrible racket and frequently broke down because they were not designed to be bumped around.Mr. Carder and his team began testing two Volkswagens and a BMW, which proved to be legal. The measuring equipment itself was finicky, too. Wires came loose, sensors failed.Marc Besch and Arvind Thiruvengadam, who as graduate students conducted test drives on the West Coast, recalled a late night spent repairing the gear in a shopping center parking lot in Portland, Ore. In Northern California, they were pulled over by a police officer suspicious of the bizarre gear protruding from the back of the test car.Over time, the researchers noticed that emissions from the vehicles — a Volkswagen Jetta and a Passat — were much higher than they should have been. But they attributed the discrepancies to technical defects or design flaws in the cars rather than deliberate wrongdoing.“It was interesting, but we never thought it would blow the lid off Volkswagen,” said Hemanth Kappanna, who also took part in the testing as a graduate student and now works at General Motors. “Never, ever.”Mr. Besch presented the team’s findings at an industry conference in San Diego in early 2014, still not realizing they had uncovered a scandal. The data piqued the interest of officials in the audience from the California Air Resources Board. CARB, as the agency is known, worked with the West Virginia group before and had let the team use state labs to calibrate equipment for the Volkswagen tests.The agency assigned its own team to find out what was going on, said Stanley Young, an agency spokesman. They tested a larger group of Volkswagen diesels, examined the cars’ computer systems and fooled the vehicles into thinking they were on the road.The agency found that the Volkswagens emitted less pollution when the engines were cold than when they had warmed up. Normally, it is the other way around.Volkswagen initially denied anything was wrong. But eventually, the agency accumulated enough evidence that company officials were forced to confess that the cars contained so-called defeat devices. The carmaker now faces lawsuits in Maryland, Massachusetts and New York claiming that management was aware of the deception.Unlike West Virginia University, California is guaranteed a payoff from its work. The state will get more than $1 billion of the money Volkswagen is spending on projects to compensate for the environmental damage it caused, though CARB will not receive any of that money. The agency will benefit indirectly, Dave Clegern, a spokesman, said.The West Virginia researchers did, however, gain recognition when the E.P.A. formally accused Volkswagen of cheating on emissions tests and took note of the university’s role.Mr. Carder said he had been floored to learn that Volkswagen tricked regulators.“It’s amazing,” Mr. Carder said, “that someone would purposely try to do something like this.”When the news broke, he was covered in grease, working in a campus lab used for testing emissions of diesel engines.His initial thought when his mobile phone started buzzing with calls from reporters was that one of the university’s mobile emissions testing labs had been in an accident.“I’m thinking, where are our crews at? Did something blow up?”
