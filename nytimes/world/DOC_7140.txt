SYDNEY, Australia — Indigenous children in the Australian state of Queensland are much likelier than others there to be held in juvenile detention, and Australia’s judicial system has held children as young as 10 criminally responsible for their actions, Amnesty International said in a report released on Wednesday.The report is the latest critical assessment of juvenile detention in Australia, after a news investigation in July by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on conditions in the Northern Territory, which adjoins Queensland. That report found that juvenile inmates, predominantly Aboriginal children, had been strapped into restraining chairs, forced to wear hoods and sprayed with tear gas. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced an official investigation in response.Amnesty International’s report on Wednesday said that while just 8 percent of children in Queensland are indigenous — that is, Aboriginal Australians or members of the Torres Strait Islanders ethnic group — they make up 65 percent of juveniles in detention. Queensland has more 10- and 11-year-old children in detention than any other Australian state, the report said.“Aboriginal children have been held in isolation for 22 hours a day, for 10 days straight,” Roxanne Moore, an indigenous rights campaigner at Amnesty International, said by telephone from Queensland’s capital, Brisbane. “We found serious human rights concerns in some detention centers.”Ms. Moore said that indigenous children “come into contact with the criminal justice system at a much younger age than non-indigenous children” in Queensland and are less likely to be let off with a warning. “They go straight to remand or into detention,” she said.Queensland’s attorney general, Yvette D’Ath, said on Wednesday that the state’s government “has already indicated that it has a zero tolerance for excessive or unauthorized use of force.”“The separation of young people in youth detention occurs only for the safety and security of the detention centers and has never been used for disciplinary purposes,” she said in a statement.Amnesty International’s report was based on research carried out from 2014 to 2016. The rights group urged Australia’s federal and state governments to establish a minimum age of 12 for criminal responsibility and said that Queensland should stop trying 17-year-olds as adults and holding inmates that age in adult prisons.
