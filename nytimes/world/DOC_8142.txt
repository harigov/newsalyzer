Merger volume has surged so far in 2015, reaching levels just shy of a record for this century.In the year through September, $3.19 trillion in deals were announced, just 2 percent below 2007 levels, according to preliminary data by Thomson Reuters.Many of the transactions were worth more than $10 billion, making up 36.5 percent of the total, the data shows. In the third quarter, this was certainly the case, as there were fewer deals than in any other three-month period this year, yet the dollar volume surpassed $1 trillion.Energy has been the top industry by value, as companies sought strength in consolidation as the price of commodities plummeted. Royal Dutch Shell’s takeover of the BG Group and Energy Transfer Equity’s agreement to acquire the Williams Companies were two of the top three deals, both in the energy industry. The second-largest deal was Charter Communication’s purchase of Time Warner Cable.There was also a slew of health care transactions, especially in insurance and pharmaceuticals.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the top-ranked financial advisers, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom came in first and Cravath, Swaine & Moore came in second for merger law firms so far this year.
