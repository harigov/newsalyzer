President Raúl Castro has unexpectedly raised the possibility of leaving his post, saying Friday that he was old and had a right to retire. But he did not say when he might do so or if such a move was imminent. Mr. Castro is scheduled to be named by Parliament to a new five-year term on Sunday. On Friday, during a joint appearance in Havana with Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, he joked with reporters and urged them to listen to his speech on Sunday. “I am going to resign,” he said. “I am going to be 82 years old,” he added, the hint of a smile on his face. “I have the right to retire, don’t you think?” Mr. Castro, who will be 82 in June, has spoken before of his desire to introduce a two-term limit for all government positions. Mr. Castro’s predecessor, his brother Fidel, is 86 and retired.
