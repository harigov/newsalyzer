 Four people — two Canadian men, a Norwegian man and a Filipino woman — were abducted on Monday night from a resort on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, the police said Tuesday. The victims were identified as John Ridsdel and Robert Hall, both of Canada, and Kjartan Sekkingstad of Norway. The identity of the Filipino woman has not yet been confirmed. The four were taken from the Oceanview Resort on Samal island, off the southern coast of Mindanao, about 11:40 p.m. Mindanao has been a frequent site of kidnappings and violence between government troops and several rebel groups, including Muslim extremists that have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. But Monday’s kidnapping is the first abduction of foreign tourists in Mindanao in more than two years. In 2012, a Swiss national, Lorenzo Vinciguerra, and Ewold Horn, from the Netherlands, were abducted while bird watching off the coast of Mindanao. Mr. Vinciguerra escaped last December. Mr. Horn is still being held.
