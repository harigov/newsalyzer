Dear Diary:I am 77. As a child and then a teenager growing up in New York City, I relied on the subway for most of my commuting. Because of the infrequency with which they ran, I, and most everyone I knew, referred to the N and R trains as “Never” and “Rarely.”When I left the city in my early 20s, I left those trains behind, along with other landmarks of my youth such as the Automat, Alexander’s and the Good Humor man.Now, after many years away, I am once again living in New York. Several months ago, around the time that the Second Avenue subway opened, I was standing on the uptown platform at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue in a crowd of frustrated commuters who, naturally, were waiting for the N or the R.Suddenly, there was a light, followed by a roar and then a glimpse of a subway car emerging from the darkness. But instead of the anticipated N or R, the car was emblazoned with a W. What did this mean? Confusion and indecision everywhere, until a large man took control.Raising his stentorian voice above the din of the murmurs, he shouted: “Well, it’s not Never; it’s not Rarely. It must be … Whatever. So take a risk. Get on board, and see where it goes.” And almost everyone who heard him did.While many things change in our wonderful city, whatever they may be, Never and Rarely live on.
