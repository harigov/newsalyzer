SEOUL, South Korea —  North Korea has announced a halt to an investigation into the fate of Japanese citizens said to have been abducted by its agents decades ago, retaliating for sanctions Japan imposed this week after the North’s latest rocket launching.North Korea blamed Japan for the development in a report on Friday from its official Korean Central News Agency, saying that Tokyo’s new sanctions were “little short of the declaration of its own scrapping” of a 2014 agreement under which North Korea set up a panel to investigate the abduction issue. The panel and its investigation were terminated as of Friday, the report said.Japan’s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, called North Korea’s decision “deplorable,” the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported.North Korea admitted in 2002 that its agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and ’80s. Five abductees were later allowed to return to Japan. The North said the others were dead, but Japan wanted a full investigation of those cases and the cases of other Japanese who Tokyo believes were also kidnapped. Resolving the emotional issue has been a pressing concern for the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe.As part of its 2014 agreement with North Korea, Japan eased some sanctions it had imposed on the North. But on Wednesday, Japan said it would restore those sanctions and add new ones in response to the North’s satellite launch on Sunday, which the United States and its allies condemned as a cover for developing long-range ballistic missile technology.The new penalties included expanded restrictions on travel between the two countries and a complete ban on visits by North Korean ships to Japan.Japan was one of the first countries to impose unilateral sanctions on the North since the rocket launching, which came just weeks after its fourth nuclear test. Also Wednesday, South Korea shut down a jointly run industrial park in the North, depriving the North Korean government of an important source of cash.
