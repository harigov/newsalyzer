SEOUL â€” Samsung's chairman was indicted Thursday on charges of tax evasion and breach of trust as a special counsel accused him of hiding billions of dollars in secret stock accounts and illegally transferring company assets to his son and heir.The indictment against the chairman, Lee Kun Hee, came hours after President Lee Myung Bak, on a trip to the United States, appealed for foreign investment in South Korea's struggling economy, promising that he would introduce "global standards" for the country's businesses.Cho Joon Woong, the special counsel, whose team has investigated the company since January, said, "Samsung has a lot of structural problems, such as allegedly illicit transfer of management control and a lack of transparency."Cho's investigation, which came with a parliamentary mandate, was another sign of painful change in South Korea, where top conglomerates have long been accused of bribing politicians,  using dubious means to engineer father-son transfers of management control and falsifying their financial records to hide corruption.But critics accused Cho's team of failing to delve deeper into the most damaging allegation against Lee Kun Hee  and some senior aides of South Korea's president: bribery. They said Cho's findings only hardened a widespread belief in South Korea that the authorities were too soft on the heads of South Korean conglomerates implicated in corruption cases."This probe was nothing but a window dressing," the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy and two other influential civic groups said in a combined statement."It's a failed investigation that didn't even reveal a tip of the iceberg of corruption in Samsung," the statement said.Samsung apologized for "causing concerns.""Taking this special prosecution investigation as a new starting point, Samsung is preparing reform plans based on advice from various sectors of our society," said Lee Soon Dong, an executive at Samsung's strategic planning office.After he was questioned by the special counsel last week, Lee Kun Hee promised to "revamp" Samsung's management lineup but stopped short of announcing his retirement. Another focal point of any shakeup would be the  strategic planning office. Lee was accused of using the strategy department to increase  his family's interest at the expense of Samsung.Nine other Samsung executives, including three from the department, were also indicted on corruption charges.Lee's family has long been admired among South Koreans  for building the conglomerate into the country's best-known global brand but also reviled because of recurring corruption scandals.Lee is  accused of hiding 4.5 trillion won, or $4.54 billion, in stock accounts held by Samsung executives and evading at least 112.8 billion won in taxes on the profits from those accounts.He also faces criminal charges of breach of trust that stemmed from something he has denied for years:  involvement in arranging for Samsung subsidiaries to sell stock to his son, Jae Yong, at a discount price so that the son could take over management control of the business empire.If convicted, Lee could face up to life in prison. But few in South Korea predict that even if convicted, Lee would spend much time in prison, because of  the practice among South Korean judges to punish corporate criminals lightly, especially when they are owners of big companies. Although he was convicted of bribery in 1995, Lee never spent a day in prison and continued to run his company.Cho, the special counsel, accused Lee and his aides of committing "grave crimes" but said he decided not to arrest them partly because they admitted to the wrongdoing and because their arrests would  disrupt the management of Samsung, which accounts for one-fifth of the country's total exports, and endanger the national economy.Parliament appointed Cho to start an investigation three months ago.Although South Korea has often been rocked by corruption scandals, the latest  has provoked widespread interest because it was caused  by a whistle-blower, unusual in South Korea.Since last October, Kim Yong Chul, a former chief legal counsel at Samsung, has claimed that Lee and his closest aides kept vast amounts of money in slush funds,  embezzled from Samsung subsidiaries and hidden in stock and bank accounts opened in the name of Kim and other Samsung executives.Kim also asserted that Samsung ran a bribery network, offering cash gifts to prosecutors, officials and politicians. Kim said he personally delivered some of these bribes and named as bribe takers several former and incumbent senior prosecutors, who won powerful government posts under  Lee Myung Bak, the new president. Those officials and Samsung have denied the bribery allegations.After raiding Samsung offices and scrutinizing thousands of stock accounts, Cho's team said it had  uncovered  4.5 trillion won in hidden funds. But it failed to find the origin of the money. Lee told the investigators that the money was part of the fortune he had inherited from his late father and Samsung founder, Lee Byung Chull.Cho also said he "suspected" that Samsung had engaged in bribery, but he could not find enough evidence. He dismissed Kim's bribery allegations as "lacking credibility." He also complained that much evidence had been destroyed and statutes of limitations on some crimes he had discovered had expired."I am so tired I feel like giving up," Kim was quoted as saying by the news agency Yonhap, expressing his frustration.Kim Ki Hwan, the chairman of Seoul Financial Forum, a group of scholars and policy makers hoping to turn South Korea into a major regional financial center, said:   "It's likely that Chairman Lee had inherited some of these funds from his father. Although there has been reform in South Korean society, he may not yet have felt comfortable enough to give up such funds. In a way, he is struggling with an original sin, a problem he has inherited from the past."The special counsel, while not arresting Lee, emphasized  that the scandal must be seen in historical context.A handful of family-controlled conglomerates led South Korea's export-driven economy in the decades after the Korean War. In recent years, accusations of improper practices  have tainted  some conglomerates as their chairmen were accused of using illegal means to hand over control to sons.The chairmen had often argued that such a transfer and strong family control was necessary to protect their companies from hostile takeover attempts from foreign investors  -  a claim that appeals to many South Koreans worried about losing the country's leading companies to overseas control.
