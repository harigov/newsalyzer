HONG KONG —  A man with a knife killed two government officials at a family planning bureau and injured four other people, the Chinese state news media reported on Wednesday, in an episode that drew wide attention in China because of continuing controversy over the country’s one-child policy.The man, identified only as having the surname He, entered the bureau on Tuesday morning in Dongxing, in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southernmost China, and began attacking people there with a knife, the state news media reported.A police officer in Dongxing confirmed in a telephone interview on Wednesday that an attack had taken place and that a suspect had been detained. The suspect had been certified by the government since 2010 as disabled because of mental illness, said the police officer, who declined to identify herself or elaborate.According to the state news media, the man had gone to the bureau on Monday to register his fourth child for permanent residency, but had been refused the registration because he had not paid a fine for having multiple children. Registration is needed to send a child to school and to qualify for many other government benefits.The one-child policy is the target of growing criticism in China partly because of the government’s uncompromising enforcement, including forcing women to have abortions as well as issuing heavy fines on families who have more than one child. The policy has also begun to shrink the number of young workers in the labor force, putting sharp upward pressure on factory wages while raising concerns about how to accommodate and financially support the steady growth in the number of elderly dependents.
