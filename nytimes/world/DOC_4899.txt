As many Americans endured long lines to cast their vote on Election Day, there was concern about voter intimidation. But some may be unsure about what exactly that entails.Here’s a general rule: If anyone at the polls is trying to directly interfere with how or whether an individual casts a ballot, that is most likely voter intimidation.There may be exceptions depending on where you are, but that is a rule of thumb offered by Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project.“If they’re interacting with the voter directly,” he said, “and in any way discouraging people from voting — interfering with their ability to vote, impeding them from voting — then that is likely a problem.”To help ensure a fair election, the A.C.L.U. joined more than 100 partners to form a nonpartisan coalition, Election Protection, administered by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The coalition offers comprehensive information on the voting process through its website and a hotline, 866-OUR-VOTE.Here’s a brief guide to spotting and dealing with voter intimidation.What does voter intimidation look like?The federal government, which has banned voter intimidation, defines the act as threatening or coercing an individual in order to interfere with his or her right to vote.Some examples, according to the A.C.L.U. and Election Protection:• Falsely representing oneself as an election official• Lying about voter requirements through phone calls, with fliers, by word-of-mouth or in other ways• Aggressively questioning a person’s qualifications to voteHow a vote can be challengedSome states allow designated poll monitors and vote challengers, though they are generally limited in some way.In some cases, poll monitors may be restricted in how close they can be to voting machines, voting booths and poll workers’ tables. They may also be barred from interacting directly with voters or looking at poll books.Vote challengers may question a voter’s eligibility, but their powers are typically limited.What should you do if someone challenges your eligibility?In many states, you may still be able to vote even if your qualifications are questioned, according to the A.C.L.U.Often, you need only to give the poll worker a sworn statement that you satisfy all requirements to vote and will then be able to cast a regular ballot.How can you report intimidation?Election Protection offers several hotlines in different languages to report voter intimidation: 866-OUR-VOTE for English, 888-Ve-Y-Vota for Spanish and 888-API-VOTE for multiple Asian languages.The Department of Justice also maintains a hotline: 800-253-3931.The Electionland project — a partnership among ProPublica, the Google News Lab, Univision, The New York Times and others — will also be tracking voting problems throughout the day.If you encounter any issues while voting, let us know by texting TIMES to 69866.Who is susceptible?This is the first presidential election in decades to take place without a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states and counties with a history of discrimination to get approval from the Justice Department before changing voting rules and procedures.Voting rights advocates are concerned that this could make African-American and Hispanic voters particularly vulnerable to attempts to keep them from casting ballots.Young people have also historically been targets of intimidation tactics. Gov. Paul LePage of Maine was accused on Monday of trying to dissuade college students from voting after he said state officials would do everything the law allows to ensure young people who voted followed all the rules to establish residency first, according to The Washington Post.Strict voter ID laws in states including Alabama, Georgia and Virginia could make it difficult for tens of thousands of transgender people to vote if their IDs do not match their gender identity, according to a study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles.
