As images of President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, with the new Saudi leader, King Salman, circulated online after their brief visit to Riyadh on Tuesday, commentators, observers watching from afar, seized on the fact that Mrs. Obama had not covered her hair during the audience with the new monarch.Reports that some Saudi bloggers had expressed anger at the first lady’s supposed show of defiance — in refusing to honor the Saudi custom that compels women in the conservative kingdom to wear headscarves or full-body cloaks — were followed by a chorus of online praise for Mrs. Obama. They were joined even by one of the president’s most avid critics, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who perhaps hopes to succeed him.However, as a number of journalists better informed about diplomatic protocol in the kingdom tried to explain, female visitors, including previous first ladies and senior officials from the United States and the leaders of other nations, have met Saudi royals, including kings, for years without covering their hair.News photographs showed that other female members in the American delegation — including the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader — also met the king without headscarves.Archival photographs of other prominent women visiting members of the royal family in years past illustrated that this was nothing new.Ahmed Al Omran, a Saudi journalist and blogger alert to the dangers of Internet-sourced reporting, tried to correct the flow of false information on Twitter. Given that there are millions of Saudi Twitter users, he noted, reports citing just 1,500 complaints about Mrs. Obama’s attire this week could hardly be used as evidence of a broad-based backlash.A look at the new king’s popular Twitter account showed that, although he is accustomed to meeting Saudi women who cloak their hair, he is also quite used to meeting female Western officials with uncovered hair — like Anne Patterson, the United States assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Other rumors about the visit, that Saudi television had blurred out images of Mrs. Obama and that she had ostentatiously frowned the entire time, also spread online despite clear visual evidence that they were untrue.
