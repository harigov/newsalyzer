BEIJING — With economic growth slowing and China’s stock markets in turmoil, the Communist Party and central government are starting to restrict the flow of economic information and data to control the narrative. That runs counter to the needs of global investors and economists, who had been hoping that China would continue becoming more transparent with such information.In 2007, Li Keqiang, who has since become China’s premier, told the United States ambassador in Beijing about the unreliability of official economic growth data. Among people tracking the Chinese economy, that kind of doubt is likely to increase. The party is becoming more sensitive as to how data shapes global perceptions of the economy.The New York Times has found prominent recent cases of data and information censorship. Last year, officials at China’s National Bureau of Statistics ordered Markit Economics, a British financial information and services company, and Caixin Media Group, based in Beijing, to end a monthly release of preliminary survey results of Chinese factories. Because traders used the number, called the flash P.M.I., the data affected markets.Here are comments from six experts on the quality and official control of Chinese economic data:Ye Tan, independent economist based in Shanghai Christopher Balding, associate professor at Peking University HSBC Business SchoolYuan Gangming, researcher at the Center for China in the World Economy, Tsinghua UniversityAnne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital ResearchMark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital EconomicsFred Hu, founding partner of Primavera Capital Group
