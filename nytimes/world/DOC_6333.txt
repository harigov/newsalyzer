The works of art that were among the most discussed of the year were monumental, historical and environmental. A lake-spanning installation by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, JR’s billboard-size artworks at the Olympics and a replica of one of Syria’s most prized archaeological treasures, a Roman arch that stood in Palmyra, all filled in blank spaces, reminding us of what was missing or what we hadn’t yet explored. Here, the creators explain their work.In Northern Italy, “The Floating Piers,” a vibrant walkway created by the installation artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, traversed villages along the shoreline and connected two small islands on Lake Iseo with the mainland, allowing more than a million visitors to experience the landscape from vantage points never seen before.Christo first conceived the project in 1970 with his partner and wife, Jeanne-Claude, who died in 2009. The 53-foot-wide walkway was open to the public for 16 days in June and July, after which it was dismantled and its parts recycled or resold.As one of the first artists in residence for the Olympic Games, the French artist JR installed three massive sculptures in Rio this year. Each depicted a young, little-known athlete frozen in action, with enormous scaffolding that served artistic and utilitarian purposes propping up the monumental works.Syria has endured unending losses in its five-year civil war, among them Palmyra’s triumphal arch, destroyed along with ancient Roman temples and towers by Islamic State militants in 2015. After consulting with Syrian academics, who chose the arch for re-creation, scientists and engineers from the Institute for Digital Archaeology, based at Oxford in Britain, replicated the arch in precise detail.The re-creation, scaled to about one-third of the original’s size, was unveiled in London in April 2016. Some Syrians who visited the arch were overcome with emotion as they were given back a small part of all that has been lost — in this case, the beauty of the craftsmanship wrought by 3rd-century stonemasons.The replica was displayed in public squares in London and New York in 2016, and will be displayed in Dubai in 2017. Next, it will be sent to Syria, to be installed near the arch’s original location.
