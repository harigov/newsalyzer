Bat Species Evolves to Suck Nectar Mid-Flight - The New York Times

Certain bats, like Pallas’s long-tongued bat, hover over flowers and suck nectar. Hovering takes a lot of energy, so the bats need to gather as much liquid as possible with each flick of their long tongues. Scientists have long known that hairlike structures known as papillae at the tips of the bats’ tongues help trap the nectar. Now, using high-speed video cameras, researchers at Brown University have seen that as the tongues extend, the papillae flare outward, becoming perpendicular.That increases the surface area and the amount of nectar that can be gathered. The researchers believe that the same muscle contraction that makes the bat’s tongue longer and thinner to reach into the flower also pushes blood into the papillae, making them erect. In the videos, the tip of the tongue turned bright red as the papillae extended, supporting the hypothesis that they were engorged with blood.View the video here.
