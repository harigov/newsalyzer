BANGKOK — As protests demanding elections grew in Bangkok, Thailand’s military junta on Sunday warned Thais against opposing military rule, saying “the process of democratization cannot be carried out right now.”A statement by the coup leader, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, which was read out by a subordinate on television Sunday, said the military sought to “bring back happiness to all Thai people.”“We would like to urge cooperation from all civil servants and police to be patient, sacrifice and accept the principle of ridding the country from conflict,” the statement said. “Otherwise, we will become a failed state and no one will be happy.”The military over the weekend ordered two dozen professors and writers to turn themselves over to the military authorities, broadening a sweep in which nearly 200 political officials have already been summoned and detained.The statement by General Prayuth said those who had surrendered were being treated well.“There is no imprisonment or torture at all,” the statement said. “We are treating them with honor.”The two dozen scholars and writers who were summoned Saturday were advocates of elections, which the protest movement had blocked and which the opposition Democrat Party had boycotted.The overthrow of the country’s elected government on Thursday has been applauded by members of the Bangkok elite, but it risks a violent backlash from voters in northern Thailand who supported the ousted politicians.The Pentagon, responding to Thursday’s military coup, announced Saturday that it was halting a military exercise with the Thai armed forces that was already underway and canceling the visit here of a top American admiral, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. The Obama administration, which suspended military aid to Thailand last week, called off other projects for police and military cooperation.The junta continued to consolidate power over the weekend, “terminating” the upper house of Parliament and purging the bureaucracy of senior officials who were seen as allies of the deposed government.The coup has been cheered in social media messages by some Thais who see it as a way to purge the influence of the former governing party and its de facto leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile and was himself ousted in the 2006 coup when he was prime minister.For a country with a traditionally freewheeling news media, the introduction of sweeping guidelines banning unfavorable coverage of the coup has been surprising.A prominent Thai reporter for the newspaper The Nation, Pravit Rojanaphruk, was summoned to an army facility and surrendered on Sunday. The Thai news media reported that editors from the country’s largest newspapers were also asked to attend a meeting with the military rulers.
