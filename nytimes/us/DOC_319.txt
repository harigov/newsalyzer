New York City’s cultural sector does not match the demographic diversity of the its population, though the sector is more diverse than arts organizations on the national level, according to a survey released on Thursday by the city’s Cultural Affairs Department.By examining the staff and leadership at city‐funded nonprofit cultural organizations, the de Blasio administration hoped to show its commitment to promoting and building diversity among arts institutions.“When it comes to making sure that every resident has an equal opportunity to contribute to this extraordinary cultural community, we need to lead by example,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. “This survey will help us find ways to foster a creative sector that opens doors for every New Yorker, regardless of their background.”The survey found that New York City’s cultural work force is 61.8 percent white, 35.4 percent minority groups, and 53.1 percent female, while the city’s residents are 33 percent white and 52 percent female, according to the 2010 U.S. census.The results also showed that diversity decreases as organizations increase in size, and that leadership tends to be less diverse than the rest of the staff.Using the data, the Cultural Affairs Department said it will now try to find ways to improve diversity through new funding efforts and a partnership with the City University of New York, to build “pipelines to employment and leadership positions that target underrepresented populations.”
