You’ve waited all week for the next episode of “Game of Thrones.” Maybe you’re watching with a spouse, or maybe you’ve gathered friends for the occasion.Experiencing any of your favorite shows with other people around produces an etiquette question with no universal answer: Is talking during the show O.K.?I wondered this as I shushed my “Game of Thrones” companion for speaking over Samwell Tarly. But later, I couldn’t stop myself from piping up when I had something to say. Extremely hypocritical, I know.How do you feel about it? Do you prefer total silence so you can absorb every word and every note of the musical score? Does running commentary make it more fun?Maybe you need to talk it out to figure out what just happened. Would you ever pause the show to discuss?I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments section or by email. I might use a selection of your comments in a follow-up article so we can get to the bottom of this.
