LOS ANGELES — California’s top judicial official asked the Trump administration on Thursday to stop immigration agents from “stalking” courthouses in the state to make immigration arrests.“Courthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country’s immigration laws,” Tani Cantil-Sakauye, the chief justice of California, wrote in a letter to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security.“Enforcement policies that include stalking courthouses and arresting undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom pose no risk to public safety, are neither safe nor fair,” she continued. “They not only compromise our core value of fairness, but they undermine the judiciary’s ability to provide equal access to justice.”Justice Cantil-Sakauye did not provide specific examples of immigration agents’ conducting arrests in courthouses, but several lawyers have reported seeing both uniformed and plainclothes immigration agents in and around courts in Southern California. Lawyers and judges in other parts of the country, including Texas and Colorado, have also complained of immigration agents in courts.Officials have repeatedly expressed fear that seeing immigration agents in court will erode public trust in the judicial system and make undocumented immigrants less likely to comply with investigations or serve as witnesses. In Colorado, one prosecutor said she had already dropped several domestic violence charges after the victims said they would no longer go to court.Federal immigration agents generally comply with what is known as the sensitive location policy, avoiding schools, hospitals and places of worship. But courts are not considered sensitive locations, and federal officials have said they are increasingly moving to make arrests there because fewer local law enforcement agencies are working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain suspects so they can be picked up and processed for deportation.Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said, “While ICE does arrest targets at courthouses, generally it’s only after investigating officers have exhausted other options.”
