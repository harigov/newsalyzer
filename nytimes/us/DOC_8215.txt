When spring arrives in China, few things are as loathed as the fuzzy, flamboyant poplar trees.They were planted by the millions in Chairman Mao’s day as a quick and cheap way to bring greenery to landscapes across China that were devastated by poverty and strife.Now they are everywhere, growing like mad and making a major nuisance of themselves. “We can’t control them any more,” said Che Shaochen, a senior researcher at the Beijing Forestry Sciences Institute.Here’s the trouble: Every spring, the female poplar trees and their willow tree cousins blanket the streets of Chinese cities with cottonlike balls of fluff known as catkins. They get into everything, clogging car radiators and irritating people’s eyes. In some places they come down so thickly that they can disrupt traffic and even cause fires.In Beijing, the capital, which has one poplar tree for about every 10 people, the municipal government has begun to fight back with a campaign to eliminate the fuzz once and for all.Officials have dispatched teams to hose down and prune thousands of trees and to inject a chemical known as birth control into trees to stop them from emitting the fuzz.The worst offenders have even been given sex-change operations of a sort: Arborists graft segments of male trees onto the female trunks.Residents of China’s smog-choked metropolises long ago grew accustomed to dealing with stubborn air pollutants. But in the springtime, nothing irks them quite like the catkins, especially when they drop uninvited into a steaming bowl of soup or suddenly swirl in the air, blocking visibility like a bad snowstorm.Chen Jimen, 43, a street sweeper who works near the Forbidden City, estimates that during the peak season he sweeps up a whole trash can’s worth of catkins every day.Liu Yingjie, 41, a taxi driver, said he had mastered the routine of regularly blasting the catkins off his car’s engine. “They entirely block your line of sight,” he said.Zhang Weiming, 27, a banker, said he stayed indoors when the catkins were in full force. “They get into your eyes and your mouth,” he said. “I never want to go outside.”
