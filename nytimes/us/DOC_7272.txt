Another high-profile chef has dropped out of Donald Trump’s forthcoming luxury hotel in the historic Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington, D.C., after Mr. Trump’s provocative statements about Mexican immigrants.Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef and a partner at the Lambs Club and other Manhattan restaurants, was to open a branch of the National, his brasserie-style restaurant in Midtown, in the new hotel. But on Thursday, he said in a written statement that “the recent statements surrounding Mexican immigrants by Donald Trump do not in any way align with my personal core values.”Mr. Zakarian’s decision to abandon the project, scheduled to open in 2016, follows that of the chef José Andrés. Mr. Andrés has said that Mr. Trump’s statements made “it impossible for my company and I to move forward.” More than half of his team is Hispanic, as are many of his guests, the chef said. On Thursday, Mr. Zakarian said, “Zakarian Hospitality employs many immigrants from nations all over the world.”Mr. Andrés is a Spanish chef who became an American citizen in 2013. Mr. Zakarian and his parents were born in this country; his ancestors emigrated from Armenia and Poland about 100 years ago.Mr. Trump said in a speech June 16 that some Mexican immigrants bring drugs and crime to the United States, and some are rapists. On Wednesday, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, called Mr. Trump and asked him to speak in more measured tones.
