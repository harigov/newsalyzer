Dear Diary:It was 1941, I was 16, and it was not necessarily a better world when I answered a help-wanted ad for a “junior public relations assistant.”I had just completed my sophomore year at Yonkers High School, but I told the prospective employer that I had graduated and that I was 18. The ad had asked applicants to identify their religion, a routine question at the time. I lied and said I was Protestant. I also didn’t acknowledge that I was just looking for a summer job.I got an interview, and I got the job. When my soon-to-be boss realized that I would be commuting to New York from Yonkers and that my fare would be 10 cents each way (a nickel for the trolley and a nickel for the subway), he said he would pay me $10.50 a week rather than the $10 listed in the ad.No references were required. There was no mention of a minimum wage, Social Security or what the hours would be.I clipped with hand scissors and pasted with a hand brush for a month and then quit to take another job with a relative who knew all the facts about me — and paid me $12 a week until I went back to school in the fall.
