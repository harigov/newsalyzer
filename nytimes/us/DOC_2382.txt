In 2014, the New York Police Department asked an oversight agency to open a channel for police lawyers to challenge the agency’s findings and proposed penalties, effectively creating an extra avenue for police pushback in a process whose final outcomes the department already controlled.Leaders of the oversight agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, offered public assurances that the department would have limited time — perhaps as few as 20 days — to launch a challenge, but the practice went into effect without any such restrictions.The board’s latest annual report, which was to be released on Wednesday, makes clear for the first time the impact of this new practice: The Police Department is challenging more and more cases and taking so long to do so — an average of almost nine months in the second half of last year — that scores of cases in which the agency already had substantiated allegations against police officers are being bogged down in delays.The report calls the lag “one of the most significant difficulties facing the C.C.R.B. with respect to the reconsideration process.”The Police Department asked the review board to reconsider substantiated allegations against 115 police officers last year, up from 99 in 2015. And police lawyers made their most prolific use of the practice toward the end of 2016, asking the board to reconsider substantiated allegations against 59 officers from September to November.The delay between the review board’s closing a case and the Police Department’s challenging some part of the board’s conclusions — either its findings or its disciplinary recommendations — has also grown.At the end of 2014, when the practice was first employed, police lawyers took an average of 47 days to ask the board to reconsider. That number rose to 103 days in the first half of 2015, 210 days in the latter half of 2015, 238 days in the first half of 2016 and 264 days in the latter half of 2016.The review board proposed new rules around June of last year that would give the Police Department 30 days to make a request for reconsideration, although the rules leave room for an extension when there is good reason. The board hopes to vote on the new rules next month.“These figures make clear the department is using reconsideration as a tool to thwart the disciplinary process, and it’s the victims of police misconduct that bear the brunt of that,” said Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union, who has strongly opposed the policy since it was proposed. “We were very concerned this was going to undermine the independence of the C.C.R.B., and these figures show that’s exactly what has happened.”The civil liberties union argued at the time that the policy returned too much power to police lawyers after earlier changes were put in place to keep the Police Department from dismissing serious misconduct cases. The police commissioner still retained the final say on any discipline.The board countered that the new review process would allow it to build trust within a skeptical Police Department by giving police lawyers a chance to raise objections. The lawyers could argue that proposed discipline was excessive, that new evidence changed a case or that the review board was misinterpreting the law.“Unless the C.C.R.B. wants to render itself completely irrelevant to police discipline, the reconsideration process is extremely important to gain respect and appropriate traction,” said Richard D. Emery, who as chairman of the review board proposed the policy before resigning in April 2016.But he acknowledged in an interview on Tuesday that it could become “a method for delay” and said, referring to the Department Advocate’s Office, that the reported delays were troubling. “That is a big problem,” he said, “and that speaks to the dysfunction of D.A.O. at the Police Department more than it does C.C.R.B.”A Police Department spokesman said in a statement: “Over all, the department is reviewing more cases from the C.C.R.B., and those cases are being reviewed more thoroughly. This thorough review process takes time.”The review board downgraded its proposed discipline against 33 officers in response to challenges last year, downgraded its findings against 18 officers, and left its decisions unchanged for 64 officers.By May 1, the department had already leveled challenges for 54 of the 522 officers who had an allegation substantiated by the board last year, a number the review board said it expected to rise as more reconsideration requests come in.Over all, the number of complaints against officers fell for a seventh straight year; the 44 percent decline over that period has become an important indicator for the Police Department and Mayor Bill de Blasio to show improved police conduct. The report also noted a continuing drop in how long it takes the board to complete investigations. The board substantiated 23 percent of fully investigated complaints in 2016, a large increase from 2011.In a statement, the review board chairwoman, Maya D. Wiley, said the report “reflects the agency’s growth — from continuing to implement efficiencies in investigations to cultivating stronger relationships with community members to streamlining processes that will yield long-term benefits.”The review board is also pursuing the most serious discipline against police officers in a substantially smaller portion of its cases than in years past, driving the rate at which the agency and the Police Department agreed on officers’ penalties to a new high. The review board recommended “charges and specifications,” which can include the loss of vacation or suspension, against 11 percent of officers with substantiated allegations last year, compared with 70 percent in 2012.The report does not explain the decline. Mr. Emery said the more serious penalties of years past were tied to the board’s efforts to rein in misconduct at the height of the stop-and-frisk era.The percentage of cases the review board closed without a full investigation also rose to 55 percent last year, from 47 percent the year before. The agency’s executive director, Jonathan Darche, said the review board had recently begun reviewing truncated cases to make sure all the required steps were taken before they were closed.
