(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. It was a hectic day for our investigative and Washington reporters.They’ve been reporting on a June 2016 meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and other top advisers with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer. Today, we published this major story on the emails setting up the meeting, which show Donald Trump Jr.’s eagerness to accept what was presented to him as the Russian government’s help.He was told the lawyer could provide dirt on Hillary Clinton. “If it’s what you say I love it,” he wrote.We asked him to comment before we published, but he pre-empted us by posting the email chain on Twitter._____2. The Trump administration’s campaign to cut government regulations is being conducted largely out of public view — and often by hires with deep industry ties and potential conflicts.Our investigative team collaborated with the nonprofit news site ProPublica to analyze the appointees working on deregulation, using records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. We found 28 appointees with potential conflicts.Separately, we learned that Trump aides asked businessmen who profited from military contracts to devise alternatives to the Pentagon’s plans for a troop surge in Afghanistan. The Defense Department is not considering their idea of using contractors instead of soldiers, an official said._____3. Senate leaders said they would unveil a revised bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, then debate and vote on it next week.But they still appear to be well short of the support needed to pass the legislation. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he would delay the Senate’s August recess by two weeks.We collected opinions from the right and left on the future of the health care bill. Above, a protest inside a Senate building._____4. The military confirmed that 16 service members were killed on Monday when a Marine Corps transport plane plunged into a field in the Mississippi Delta.Their names have not yet been released. The flight took off from an air station in North Carolina, and was headed to a naval facility in California for a training exercise.Six of the those aboard were assigned to the Marine Raiders, an elite special operations force that deploys to Afghanistan and Iraq, among other countries._____5. Our correspondent took a tour of Mosul a day after the Iraqi government declared victory over the Islamic State in the city.What she found was rubble, death and devastation. In some parts of the city artillery fire could still be heard.“While this is a major moment for Iraq,” she wrote, “I doubt this fight is over.”_____6. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is using shuttle diplomacy to try to end the standoff between four Arab nations and Qatar.He signed a “memorandum of understanding” with Qatar’s foreign minister, outlining ways the country could fortify its fight against terrorism and address terrorism funding.The dispute has pushed Qatar closer to Iran, which has stepped in with planeloads of fresh vegetables and other support._____7. The International Olympic Committee will announce the host cities for the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics at the same time this September.The mayors of Paris and Los Angeles, the front-runners, were in Switzerland today to make formal presentations, above. Voting by I.O.C. delegates will take place on Sept. 13 in Peru.The Games are trying to generate excitement amid corruption and doping scandals and diminished interest from potential host nations leery of the high costs._____8. Boston is seeing the most intense building frenzy in its 400-year history, and there’s worry that glassy towers will bathe the city’s prized parks in darkness.The state’s strict laws to protect sunlight and open space are being tested by developers who are trying to change “the shadow laws,” saying preservation must be balanced with economic development.“The ultrarich will get great views, but there will be permanent damage to the people’s parks,” one critic warned._____9. People with disabilities tend to receive worse medical treatment and less routine care. Our writer has a proposal to change that: recruit more medical professionals who are themselves disabled.“I’m a guy in a wheelchair sitting right next to my patients,” said Dr. Gregory Snyder, above, who became paralyzed from an injury in medical school. “They know I’ve been in that bed just like they have. And I think that means something.”_____10. Finally, it’s been a hot, dry spell at Wimbledon, where Novak Djokovic was among those criticizing match officials over court conditions and scheduling. He plays his quarterfinal match against Tomas Berdych on Wednesday.And Venus Williams, above, advanced to the semifinals for the second year in a row by beating Jelena Ostapenko. Williams, 37, made her Wimbledon debut a few weeks after Ostapenko, 20, was born.Have a great night._____Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
