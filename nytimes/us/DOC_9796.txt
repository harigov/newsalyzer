NEW YORK â€” Time Warner announced  that the chairman and chief executive of its Home Box Office unit, Chris Albrecht, had agreed to resign at the company's request, three days after he was arrested and charged with assaulting a girlfriend in a Las Vegas parking lot.Albrecht's resignation, on Wednesday night, came a day after he announced he was taking a leave of absence. In a memorandum to his colleagues  Tuesday, Albrecht said that he was an alcoholic and that the incident in Las Vegas, on which he did not elaborate, was the result of a lapse in his sobriety.His departure comes at an uncertain time for HBO. Its marquee series "The Sopranos" ends its six-season run next month, and as the channel's chief executive, Albrecht was intimately involved in assembling the next slate of shows.In a statement by Time Warner, Albrecht said: "With great regret, at the request of Time Warner, I have agreed to step down as chairman and CEO of Home Box Office. I take this step for the benefit of my Home Box Office colleagues, recognizing that I cannot allow my personal circumstances to distract them from the business."The chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, Richard Parsons, said that Albrecht's resignation was "the right decision for the company."Wednesday's events unfolded as The Los Angeles Times reported that in 1991, HBO  paid a settlement of at least $400,000 to a subordinate of Albrecht's who had accused him of choking her during a confrontation in her office.The newspaper said that the woman, Sasha Emerson, had been romantically involved with Albrecht, and that the payment was made in connection with her departure from the cable channel.The newspaper's account was confirmed Wednesday by two people who had been briefed on details of the settlement, but were not authorized to discuss it. One of those people said that no police report or lawsuit had been filed in connection with that incident.The lawyer representing Albrecht in Las Vegas, David Chesnoff, referred all inquiries Wednesday to Steven Rubenstein, a publicist in New York. Reached Wednesday night, Rubenstein, referring to Albrecht, said, "It would be inappropriate for him to comment."In an e-mail message to HBO employees Tuesday, Albrecht said that "what occurred in Las Vegas this weekend" represented "a wake-up call to me of a weakness I thought I had overcome long ago.""I had been a sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous for 13 years," he wrote. "Two years ago, I decided that I could handle drinking again. Clearly, I was wrong."The company's chief operating officer, Bill Nelson, a longtime HBO executive, has assumed Albrecht's duties until a permanent successor is selected.It will now fall to Nelson, and others in the inner circle that Albrecht leaves behind, to nurture and promote shows intended as successors not only to "The Sopranos" but to two other signature series that ended in recent years, "Sex and the City" and "Six Feet Under." The first new entry, "John from Cincinnati," which weaves elements of troubled family life and surfing, is to have its debut on June 10, immediately after the last scene in "The Sopranos."Neither HBO, Time Warner nor the authorities have said much about the circumstances surrounding Albrecht's arrest.On Monday,  Martin Wright, an   officer with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police,  said the incident occurred around 3 a.m. Sunday in the valet parking area of the MGM Grand Hotel, the site of a superwelterweight championship fight between Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather Jr. HBO had broadcast the fight.The officer described the altercation as "a battery" and defined such an offense as involving "hitting, choking or shoving." The police have said the victim was Albrecht's girlfriend, but they have not released her name.Kathy Karstedt, the secretary to the district attorney in Las Vegas,  said Wednesday that the office had not yet received the case from the police, and thus had not formally filed any charges in court.Bill Carter, Michael Cieply and Geraldine Fabrikant  contributed reporting.
