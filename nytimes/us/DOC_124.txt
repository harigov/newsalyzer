Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.John Oliver, the host of the comedy-news show “Last Week Tonight,” is on a two-week vacation. On “The Late Show” on Wednesday, he admitted to Stephen Colbert that he could have chosen a slower news cycle to sit out.He expressed a particular bafflement at Donald Trump Jr.’s apparent indifference in the face of a growing scandal.Mr. Oliver said that his team’s old off-air jokes about the Trump administration were proving prescient.President Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning to assure his supporters that he was not spending too much time watching TV — something that made Stephen Colbert a little uneasy.That tweet may have been a response to Politico’s report this week that Mr. Trump “is using his relatively light schedule to watch TV and fume.”Trevor Noah welcomed audiences “to the first of what I assume will be many Doncathlons,” with events like the “Hillary deflection” and the “giant leap.”Over on “The Late Show,” John Oliver became a member of its Trump Attacked Me on Twitter Hall of Fame.The rapper and actor 50 Cent will talk to Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday. He recently entered the fray over Floyd Mayweather’s money woes; he might want to talk to Guillermo Rodriguez, Mr. Kimmel’s sidekick, who interviewed Mr. Mayweather on Wednesday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”Jordan Peele scored an enormous hit this year with “Get Out.” What’s next for his former “Key and Peele” co-star, Keegan-Michael Key?
