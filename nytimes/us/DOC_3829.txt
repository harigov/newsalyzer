It’s been almost 47 years since the murders orchestrated by Charles Manson in California. For younger generations to know about those crimes and understand the shock of them requires some passing-down of the story. A made-for-TV movie on Saturday, Feb. 6, on Lifetime tries to do this, and its cast embodies a passing-down tradition of its own: It includes several young actors following in a parent’s footsteps.The film is called “Manson’s Lost Girls” and focuses on the women of the Manson compound. Greer Grammer (daughter of Kelsey Grammer and Barrie Buckner) plays Leslie Van Houten. Eden Brolin (daughter of Josh Brolin and Alice Adair) is Susan Atkins. And Christian Madsen (son of Michael Madsen and Jeannine Bisignano) plays Tex Watson, another member of the Manson Family.But it falls to MacKenzie Mauzy’s character, Linda Kasabian, to sum up the crimes near the film’s end during a confessional meeting with the prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi. “Sometimes the only thing that makes sense is no sense,” she tells him.
