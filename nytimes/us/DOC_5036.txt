At least 70 people, including 60 foreign tourists, were killed outside a 3,400-year-old temple here this morning, in what Government officials called the deadliest attack by Islamic militants  in their five-year campaign to overthrow the Egyptian Government.While the militants had attacked foreigners in the past, today's strike brought the violence for the first time to the tombs and temples here that have attracted so many visitors in recent years that Luxor had come to resemble a Pharaonic theme park.At 8:45 this morning, as tourists left their buses and walked toward a staircase leading to the Temple of Hatshepsut, they ran into what was apparently a carefully planned ambush by six gunmen who concealed themselves in the structure.The battle between militants and the police that followed sent gunfire crackling for three hours among the sites on the west bank of the Nile, which is home to the famed Valley of the Kings and the tomb of Tutankhamen. Egyptian authorities said all six attackers were killed.Egypt's Interior Ministry said the dead among the tourists included Swiss, Germans and Japanese. The British Foreign Office said six Britons were among the victims. United States officials said they had not been told that any Americans were among the dead.The massacre seemed bound to exact a heavy toll on an economy that depends heavily on foreign tourism. Only last month, the temple was the scene of a gala moonlight performance of Verdi's opera ''Aida'' sponsored by the Egyptian Government, which has been trying to draw even more tourists to Luxor. The total is now two million a year.Tonight, a very different mood was cast by the flashing red light of a solitary police vehicle that stood watch outside the massive structure, which is partly carved into a limestone cliff. Armed policemen barred reporters from the scene and from a nearby hospital that had been turned into a mortuary for the victims.Hours after the early-morning attack, the details of what happened remained imprecise. The Government gave no breakdown by nationality of those who were killed, and it did not say whether any group had taken responsibility for the attack.But an Egyptian taxi driver wounded in the shooting said in a hospital here tonight that the attackers had worn red headbands identifying them as members of the Islamic Group, the largest of the militant organizations fighting to topple the Government of President Hosni Mubarak and replace it with an Islamic state.Reuters and Agence France- Presse quoted reports that pamphlets left at the scene of the attack appeared to link it to the Islamic Group. And Egypt's official television referred to the attackers as ''terrorist elements.'' President Hosni Mubarak convened an emergency meeting of his Cabinet tonight.Mr. Mubarak made no public statement, but the Tourism Minister,  Mamdou el-Beltagi, told reporters at a travel fair in London that he felt ''shock and sorrow'' at ''this cowards' crime committed against our guests and Egyptians as well.'' The minister was quoted as saying that the Government was doing all it could to protect tourists, but added that it was too early to predict the impact of the massacre on Egypt's $3 billion-a-year tourism industry.According to accounts by several witnesses, the attack began as a group of tourists who had just arrived by bus began to walk from a parking lot toward a broad stairway leading into the three-level temple, built as the resting place of the Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut, who ruled from 1492 to 1458 B.C.Some witnesses, including the taxi driver, Badawi Ahmed Salam, 33, said the assailants had opened fire from several levels of the temple, first killing police guards and then turning their guns upon tourists.The Interior Ministry said the six assailants had been armed with six automatic weapons, two handguns and hand-made explosives. One was shot dead at the scene, but the others were not killed until hours of carnage had passed. At one point, according to the police, they boarded a bus to kill Japanese tourists.Only after they tried to flee the scene by hijacking a tour bus and then running into forbidding hills were the last five assailants slain by the police, some three hours after their attack began. And even then, hundreds of troops scoured the hills and the surrounding desert in search of possible accomplices to the attack.Among those whom the Egyptian Government said were killed in the shooting were two policemen and two Egyptian civilians.Another 25 people were wounded, 16 of them foreign tourists. Some were so seriously wounded that they were flown by military helicopters to hospitals in Cairo, 315 miles to the north.As the gun battle raged, hundreds of tourists who began their day by crossing from the luxury hotels in Luxor to the sites on the west bank found themselves pinned down. Many of them cowered in fear inside the temples.''Everyone here is just absolutely devastated,'' a British tourist said tonight. Like most other foreign witnesses still in Luxor this evening, she refused to give her name or to talk much about what she had seen.Since they began their violent campaign in 1992, Islamic militants in Egypt had killed 34 foreigners in bombings, shootings and other attacks that have left more than 1,200 people dead in all. They also include 9 German tourists killed two months ago in an attack on their tour bus in central Cairo, and 18 Greek tourists who were killed in April 1996.Over the years, the militants have issued several warnings for foreign tourists to leave Egypt. But tourists have flooded back to Egypt in recent years as a harsh Government crackdown has sharply decreased the level of violence.Since 1993, the number of foreign tourists visiting Egypt has increased from 2.5 million to a projected level of 4.2 million this year, a record.The timing of today's attack suggests that it may have been intended to coincide with a military trial beginning in Cairo of 66 suspected militants accused of plotting to kill Government officials.In addition to the red headband glimpsed by one witness, the evidence linking the Islamic Group to today's attack included pamphlets  emblazoned with the group's name and left near the scene, Agence  France- Presse reported.Reuters quoted a tour-agency employee, Ahmed Youssef, as saying that he had seen a pamphlet that read ''No to tourists in Egypt'' and that was signed ''Omar Abdel Rahman's Squadron of Havoc and Destruction.'' Sheik Abdel Rahman, the spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, is serving a life sentence in the United States for plotting to blow up the World Trade Center.The Swiss Foreign Ministry said it thought as many as 20 Swiss nationals were among the slain tourists.
