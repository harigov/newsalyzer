GENEVA — The United Nations top human rights official called on Thursday for an international inquiry into possible war crimes and other accusations of abuses in Yemen, reviving a proposal that Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government it supports have fiercely resisted.Other nations have “a legal and moral duty” to act, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement released with a report by investigators that will almost certainly anger the Saudi authorities.The report documented attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure during  18 months of conflict between Saudi-led coalition forces supporting Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the ousted president, and forces aligned with Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.Those responsible for violations and abuses against civilians enjoy impunity in Yemen, Mr. al-Hussein said, adding that “such a manifestly, protractedly unjust situation must no longer be tolerated by the international community.”The report and Mr. al-Hussein’s recommendation will be presented to the Human Rights Council next month; there was no immediate comment from the Saudi representatives in Geneva.Although the report details accusations of abuses by all parties to the conflict in Yemen, much of the focus will be on Saudi Arabia, which is the subject of mounting international criticism over the heavy toll from repeated airstrikes on civilian targets. A rocket attack last week  killed 19 people in a hospital run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.At least 3,799 civilians have been killed, and 6,711 wounded since fighting flared in March 2015, Mr. al-Hussein said, emphasizing the heavy humanitarian toll from the war in a one of the world’s poorest nations. In a country of 24 million people, 2.4 million have fled their homes, and 7.6 million are suffering from malnutrition, he said.The report released on Thursday showed that 60 percent of the civilian deaths documented in a one-year period resulted from airstrikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition on weddings, markets, schools and hospitals. In several of those attacks, the United Nations said it was unable to identify any possible military target.Last year, Saudi Arabia successfully lobbied hard to block a resolution in the Human Rights Council that would have established an international commission of inquiry.The United States and other Western allies of Saudi Arabia backed off from that resolution after Yemen’s government, which was in exile at the time, agreed to begin a national inquiry.Mr. al-Hussein’s office said it had provided training and technical support to the national body but had concluded that it had not worked to international standards. Its members lacked access to parts of the country and a report they submitted focused largely on accusations of abuses by the Houthis.The 36-page report released by the United Nations on Thursday also documented abuses by the Houthis and forces aligned with them.The investigators cited several deadly episodes, including a July 2015 attack on a residential area of the southern port city of Aden that killed 107 civilians, and rocket attacks in the city of Taiz in June that killed 18 civilians, which were attributed to the Houthis and their allies. They also reported numerous attacks on journalists and efforts by Houthi authorities to close down news websites and intimidate opposition politicians.The United Nations also detailed heavy civilian casualties from airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition, continuing a reporting process that has infuriated Saudi officials.The Saudi government has accused the United Nations of bias and of ignoring Houthi violations, and the 29-person team of United Nations human rights investigators working in Yemen has been denounced in Arabic-language news outlets and on social media.Personal attacks have eased in recent months, but they continue on social media and “put our colleagues in the field in great danger,” said Mohammad Ali Alnsour, chief of the United Nations rights office’s Middle East section.The report also cited the use of cluster munitions by coalition forces in residential areas, a delicate issue for the United States and Britain, which have supplied billions of dollars of arms and munitions to Saudi Arabia and which have worked with the coalition on its targeting.“The resilience of the Yemeni people has been stretched beyond human limits,” the report said. Other nations had “a legal and moral duty to take urgent steps to alleviate the appalling levels of human despair” and to ensure accountability for abuses.
