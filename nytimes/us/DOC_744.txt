To the Editor:Re “Lost Paperwork May Erase Student Debt for Tens of Thousands” (front page, July 18):I was nursing our first baby when a collector phoned late at night with threats and demands about a payment on my husband’s student loan. It was the first time in seven years we had been late with a payment. The payment was only a few days late, and I had the canceled check to prove it. And yet, I was frightened.My husband’s degree enabled him to pursue a career that over time made the loan a good investment. But taking out loans is riskier today. Costs are much higher, and steady employment is much more difficult to find.This is why when I read about an industry’s mishandling of loan collections, I worry about all those caught in its machinations. I also worry about the dangers being created by the Trump administration and the Republican Congress as they wipe out consumer protections.ANNLIN KRUGER, BAR HARBOR, ME.
