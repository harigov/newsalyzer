That black hole that was going to eat the Earth? Forget about it, and keep making the mortgage payments — those of you who still have them.A new particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, scheduled to go into operation this fall near Geneva, is no threat to the Earth or the universe, according to a  safety review that was approved Friday by the governing council of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, which is building the collider.“There is no basis for any concerns about the consequences of new particles or forms of matter that could possibly be produced by the LHC,” the safety assessment group wrote in the report.Whatever the collider will do, they said, nature has already done many times oversummary.The report is  available on the Web at lsag.web.cern.ch/lsag/LSAG-Report.pdf.The  machine is designed to speed protons, the building blocks of ordinary matter, to energies of seven trillion electron volts, then crash them together to produce tiny  fireballs, miniature versions of the Big Bang.Some critics argue  that CERN has ignored or played down  a risk that the collider could produce a black hole that would swallow the Earth or create some other dangerous particle.The safety group, however, pointed out that cosmic rays have produced equally energetic collisions with the Earth and other objects in the cosmos over and over again. But the stars and galaxies endure.
