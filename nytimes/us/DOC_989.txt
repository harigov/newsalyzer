The N.C.A.A. unveiled a questionnaire Friday that requires current and prospective host cities of its championship competitions “to specifically outline how they will protect participants and spectators from discrimination,” including details on how they would mitigate any local discriminatory laws or rules that permit the refusal of services to members of any group.The policy change, first hinted at in April, was announced a day after the N.B.A.’s decision to withdraw next year’s All-Star Game from Charlotte drew the ire of the state’s Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who is running for re-election this year.Both decisions were made in reaction to a state law passed this year that eliminated anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and it cast doubt over currently scheduled Division I basketball championship games in the state.Sites currently bidding on games must complete the questionnaire by Aug. 12, while cities that already have been named as host sites — including two North Carolina cities, Greensboro and Charlotte, which are scheduled to host first- and second-round men’s tournament games in 2017 and 2018 — will have a later, yet-to-be-determined deadline.Among other questions, the questionnaire asks, “Does your city, county/parish and/or state have provisions that allow for refusal of accommodations or service to any person?”It also requires that potential hosts specifically answer the question, How would you “provide an environment that is safe, healthy, and free of discrimination, plus safeguards the dignity of everyone involved with the event?”The questionnaire followed a policy set in April by the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors that requires championship sites — both those already selected and those bidding to host — to “demonstrate” how they will cultivate a tolerant, discrimination-free environment.“The questionnaire in and of itself is a tangible step to help ensure that N.C.A.A. events are held in an L.G.B.T.-inclusive environment,” said Hudson Taylor, the executive director of Athlete Ally, a nonprofit that fights homophobia and transphobia in sports.He added, “We do hope the N.C.A.A. will follow up on this announcement with more detail on how the results of this questionnaire will be reviewed and acted upon.”An N.C.A.A. spokeswoman declined to comment Friday other than to direct a reporter to the existing statements, including the questionnaire.The N.C.A.A. has a history of taking progressive stances on social issues. More than a decade ago, it barred teams with Native American-themed mascots from participating in its postseason tournaments (there are a few exceptions, such as the Florida State Seminoles, who have an agreement with that tribe). It does not stage preplanned postseason games in states that fly some variant of the Confederate battle flag, a category now limited to Mississippi.Last year the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, lobbied Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana — now the Republican vice-presidential nominee — to clarify a state law seen as discriminatory to L.G.B.T. people that was passed days before the Final Four was staged in Indianapolis, which is also the city in which the association is headquartered.Days after the passing of the North Carolina law, commonly known as House Bill 2, Harris Pastides, the University of South Carolina president and the chairman of the Division I board of directors, pledged “a more proactive stand” from his organization.It can be difficult for the N.C.A.A. to take politically charged stands, however, since it is a membership association that includes more than 1,000 institutions, including several Christian universities whose religious beliefs on issues like homosexuality, premarital sex and abortion have led the federal government to grant them partial exemptions to Title IX, a federal law that protects against sex and gender discrimination.Indeed, the questionnaire asks host sites, “Does your host institution(s) hold a Title IX waiver for religious accommodations or have you applied to Office of Civil Rights for such a waiver?”Several prominent college teams are based in North Carolina, including the flagship state university’s Tar Heels and the Duke Blue Devils. One of the country’s most prominent leagues, the Atlantic Coast Conference, is based there and stages its football championship game in Charlotte.The A.C.C. commissioner, John Swofford, said Thursday that the N.B.A.’s decision to move its All-Star Game would not immediately affect the conference’s plans, but he suggested that there would be “further discussion” about them.
