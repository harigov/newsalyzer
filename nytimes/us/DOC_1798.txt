Franny’s, a Brooklyn restaurant that opened in 2004, became a family-friendly favorite among Prospect Heights and Park Slope residents, and gained even wider recognition, will close after dinner on Aug. 20. The owners, Francine Stephens and Andrew Feinberg, gave no reason, announcing, “It’s time to say goodbye” on the restaurant’s website.Ms. Stephens and Mr. Feinberg could not be reached for comment.At one time, Ms. Stephens and Mr. Feinberg owned three businesses on a stretch of Flatbush Avenue: Franny’s, which moved to the Park Slope side of Flatbush Avenue from its original location across the street, in Prospect Heights; Bklyn Larder, a fine grocery and prepared food shop; and Marco’s, an Italian trattoria, which moved into the original Franny’s space. Praised by critics, Marco’s closed in 2014, citing a lack of business. Bklyn Larder was recently sold.Franny’s, 348 Flatbush Avenue (Sterling Place), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 230-0221; frannysbrooklyn.com.
