Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire wanted to be clear late Monday: There are no role models in this year’s presidential race.Earlier in the evening, Ms. Ayotte — a freshman Republican in a tight re-election race — seemed less sure on that point.“I think that certainly there are many role models that we have, and I believe he can serve as president,” she said of Donald J. Trump during a debate with her Democratic challenger, Gov. Maggie Hassan.That led to jeers on social media, and a bit of confusion — Ms. Ayotte has yet to officially endorse Mr. Trump, although she has said she would vote for him.“I misspoke tonight,” Ms. Ayotte said in a statement several hours later. “While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example, and I wouldn’t hold up either of them as role models for my kids.”Her attempt to walk back her debate comments did not quiet her Twitter critics.“Trump just spent a week fat-shaming a woman and bragging about not paying taxes,” one wrote. “Kelly Ayotte calls him a role model.”Added another: “Kelly Ayotte says ‘Donald Trump is absolutely a role model for kids.’ She’s right, kids don’t pay taxes either.”And she may have started a meme for the presidential campaign, with one tweet suggesting: “If you’re interviewing a Republican tomorrow you’re obligated to ask the Kelly Ayotte question.”As one of a handful of Republican senators running for re-election in states that voted for President Obama in both 2008 and 2012, Ms. Ayotte is considered particularly vulnerable this year. The contest between her and Ms. Hassan is one of the nation’s tightest Senate races.
