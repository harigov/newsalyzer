Deutsche Bank, the German financial giant that has a significant business in the United States, said on Tuesday that it would freeze its plans to add jobs in North Carolina, a response to the passage last month of a state law that, among other things, eliminates antidiscrimination protections based on sexual orientation.Deutsche Bank had planned to create 250 positions at its technology development center in Cary, N.C., a municipality near Raleigh, that currently employees 900 people.In explaining why those plans had been delayed, John Cryan, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, took aim at the new law, which also bars transgender people from using bathrooms that do not match their gender at birth.“We’re proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our U.S. expansion plans for now,” Mr. Cryan said in a statement, “We very much hope that we can revisit our plans to grow this location in the near future.”PayPal, an electronic payments company, announced last week that it was not going ahead with a plan to add 400 jobs, in protest of the law. And scores of chief executives of other large corporations spoke out against the law in a letter sent to North Carolina’s governor, Pat McCrory.Deutsche Bank has had operations in Cary since 2009. The bank had planned to spend $9 million in the expansion this year, and the additional jobs were expected to pay out total compensation of more than $21 million a year. North Carolina agreed to give Deutsche Bank tax reimbursements if the bank fulfilled job creation requirements. In a news release in September, Mr. McCrory spoke positively about Deutsche Bank’s expansion, saying it highlighted features that drew companies to the state, including competitive costs and a “great quality of life.”
