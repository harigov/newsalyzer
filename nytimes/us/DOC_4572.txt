“Blow-Up,” Michelangelo Antonioni’s first English-language film, caused a sensation when it opened in 1966, and for good cause. The ambiguous mystery, of a fashion photographer (David Hemmings) who may have caught a murder on film during a shoot in a park, captures the mod vitality of Swinging London — including an iconic photo session with the supermodel Veruschka — but uses it as background for a meditation on death and reality. A new restoration, at Film Forum for a week starting on Friday, July 28, is especially resonant in this Instagram era. (filmforum.org)“Blow-Up” features the crisp, vivid cinematography of Carlo Di Palma, who worked closely with Antonioni on “Red Desert,” and collaborated with Woody Allen on some of his best films, including “Hannah and Her Sisters” and “Husbands and Wives.” Also starting Friday, the Film Society of Lincoln Center hosts a weeklong Di Palma survey, along with the premiere of “Water and Sugar: Carlo Di Palma, The Colours of Life.” (filmlinc.org)
