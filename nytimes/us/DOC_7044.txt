GENEVA —  In one of its stronger resolutions, the United Nations Human Rights Council urged global powers on Friday to back an international criminal investigation of North Korea for crimes against humanity and to consider targeted sanctions against those responsible.In a resolution that the council’s 47 members adopted by a vote of 30 to 6, with 11 abstentions, it called on the United Nations Security Council to take action, including referring North Korea to some form of international judicial process “in order that those responsible for human rights violations, including those that may amount to crimes against humanity, are held to account.”“You couldn’t expect a stronger resolution,” Julie de Rivero, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, said of the measure. “The package as a whole is unprecedented.”The reaction from North Korea was blunt. “Mind your own business,” its ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, So Se-pyong, told the Human Rights Council, rejecting the resolution as “a product of confrontation” and rebuffing calls for cooperation with United Nations rights monitors. “No person on earth would be so stupid as to keep the door open to a gangster who is attacking with a sword,” he said.Leaving the council after the vote, he told journalists, “This will aggravate tensions; it will make things worse.”The resolution closely followed the recommendations of a commission of inquiry submitted last month that was considered the most authoritative assessment of human rights in North Korea. Led by a retired Australian judge, Michael Kirby, the commission documented in often gruesome detail violations ranging from the “crime of extermination” to the brutal conditions in concentration camps, including enslavement, torture, rape and persecution on grounds of race, religion and gender.That report and, now, the resolution represent a concerted effort by rights activists and United Nations human rights officials to broaden the focus of international attention from North Korea’s nuclear policies and to include decades of abuse on a scale that Navi Pillay, the organization’s human rights chief, has remarked “has no parallel anywhere in the world.”In compiling the report, the commission wrote to Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, advising him that he might be held personally liable in court for crimes against humanity committed by state institutions and officials under his direct control.The International Criminal Court in The Hague would be the preferred option for investigating North Korea, Mariangela Zappia, the European Union ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and a sponsor of the resolution, said after the vote on Friday. The referral, however, could come only from the Security Council, where China, North Korea’s longstanding protector, wields a veto. But the resolution leaves open the possibility of recourse to other mechanisms, like an ad hoc international tribunal of the sort set up for Rwanda and the Balkans.In the meantime, the resolution renewed the mandate of a special rapporteur monitoring human rights in North Korea and called on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a “field presence” in the country, assigning permanent staff to monitor human rights developments. The staffing and location of such a presence are still under discussion, with possibilities including South Korea, Japan and Thailand, where the United Nations already has a regional office.
