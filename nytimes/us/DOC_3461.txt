DESPITE recent news stories of a population exodus from Detroit, there are many reasons to make a pilgrimage to this struggling city right now — and not just because Eminem’s slick Super Bowl commercial showcased the inner strength of the Motor City. No video can portray the passion one finds on the streets of Detroit these days, where everyone from the doorman to the D.J. will tell you they believe in this city’s future. While certain areas are indeed eerily empty, other neighborhoods — including midtown, downtown and Corktown — are bustling with new businesses that range from creperies and barbecue joints catering to the young artists and entrepreneurs migrating to Motown, to a just-opened hostel that invites tourists to explore Detroit with the aid of local volunteer guides. In the historic Brush Park district, architecture buffs will find some lovely refurbished houses, and along Woodward Avenue, restored film palaces are a wonderful reminder that this city’s storied past includes not just automobiles, but also the entertainment industry. No urban enthusiast will want to miss the recovery that Detroit is now attempting.Friday 2 p.m.1) GROOVE TIMEGet into the beat with a visit to the Motown Historical Museum (2648 West Grand Boulevard; 313-875-2264; motownmuseum.com), where the tour guides are nearly as entertaining as the artists who recorded their songs here at Berry Gordy Jr.’s studio, Hitsville U.S.A., in the early 1960s. Packed with memorabilia — from the Marvelettes’ album covers to the Jackson Five’s psychedelic bell bottoms — you can’t help but hum the tunes of Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder, as you wander into Studio A, where it all began. 5 p.m.2) FRENCH FLAVORDetroit’s French colonial roots are easily recalled at the rouge-walled Good Girls Go to Paris Crepes (15 East Kirby, Suite 115; 877-727-4727; goodgirlsgotopariscrepes.com) — the city was called Le Detroit at its founding in 1701. Try the Celeste sandwich (Brie, cranberries and roast beef, $8.50), and an ooh-la-la dessert called the Fay (banana, caramel, pecans and brown sugar, $7). 7 p.m.3) MURALS AND MUSICThe Detroit Institute of Arts (5200 Woodward Avenue; 313-833-7900; dia.org) stays open until 10 p.m. on Fridays and houses works by Picasso, Matisse, van Gogh and Warhol. But it is the Rivera Court, decorated with Diego Rivera’s “Detroit Industry” fresco, where visitors should head, not just for the magnificent murals but also free concerts every Friday at 7 and 8:30 p.m. Admission: $8. 10 p.m.4) COOL CAT CAFE Don’t let the strip joint across the street stop you from entering Café d’Mongo’s (1439 Griswold Street; cafedmongos.com), a wonderfully eccentric speakeasy that feels more like a private party than a bar. With live jazz and country music on alternating weeks, the atmosphere is as retro as the orange leather banquettes, vintage Detroit photographs and scuffed instruments hanging on the walls. With a well-priced bar (drinks start at $4) and a straightforward menu (the owner, Larry Mongo, prepares barbecued ribs and chicken on a smoker outside), the popular Café d’Mongo is only open Friday nights and occasionally the last Saturday of each month.Saturday 8 a.m.5) TO MARKET WE GOAt the six-block Saturday Eastern Market (2934 Russell Street; Detroiteasternmarket.com; 313-833-9300) some 250 vendors sell everything from fruits and vegetables to local cheeses and artisanal breads. Stop in at nearby R. Hirt Jr. Co. (2468 Market Street; 313-567-1173), a specialty goods store founded in 1887, and the Marketplace Antiques Gallery (2047 Gratiot Avenue; 313-567-8250) , where a turn-of-the-century Chinese Rosewood vanity was recently selling for $250. Stop in at the Russell St. Deli (2465 Russell Street; 313-567-2900; russellstreetdeli.com), where breakfast is served all day on Saturdays, and includes raisin bread French toast, slathered with toasted pecans or fresh fruit ($7.75). 10 a.m.6) MODEL T BIRTHPLACEThe Model T Automotive Heritage Complex (461 Piquette Street; 313-872-8759; tplex.org), the birthplace of the Model T, is Henry Ford’s meticulously restored first factory, which opened in 1904. Be sure to visit the “secret experimental room” where Ford invented the vehicle that made driving popular. The $10 admission includes a tour — children under 16 are free. 12 p.m.7) FIRE UP YOUR BELLYLocated in Corktown, within view of the now sadly abandoned Michigan Central Station, Slows Bar BQ (2138 Michigan Avenue; 313-962-9828; slowsbarbq.com) makes this downtown area a must-visit destination with its baby back ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken wings. With an interior of salvaged lumber, brick walls and a wrap-around bar, Slows is a hit with everyone from old-timers to young hipsters. Dinner costs about $20. 2 p.m.8) A MATINEE MOMENTThe one thing not missing in this city is theaters — almost all are housed in historic buildings that have been pristinely restored over the last two decades; together they make up the second-largest theater district in the United States after Broadway. On a recent afternoon, matinee choices included a children’s show at the former movie palace Fox Theater, with 5,000 seats (olympiaentertainment.com); a comedy at the intimate Gem Theater (gemtheatre.com); a dance troupe at the breathtakingly renovated Detroit Opera House, which opened in 1922 (motopera.org); a Broadway musical at the Fisher Theater (broadwayindetroit.com); and a performance by the Detroit Symphony at Orchestra Hall (Detroitsymphony.com). 6 p.m.9) CHEAP AND CHEERFULThe best happy hour deal in town is at Roast, a brasserie inside the newly renovated Westin Book Cadillac Hotel (1128 Washington Boulevard; 313-961-2500; roastdetroit.com). Sidle up to the bar and start ordering. Selected cocktails are $5, beer and wine, $4, and the bar food includes creamy macaroni and cheese ($4) and a huge paper cone of hot fries ($3). 9 p.m.10) JAZZ IT UPCliff Bell’s (2030 Park Avenue; 313-961-2543; cliffbells.com, $10 cover), which first opened in 1935, is one of the oldest supper clubs in Detroit; after years of meticulous renovations, it is once again the place to be. With its Art Deco décor, vaulted ceilings, mahogany bar and mirrored walls, to say nothing of the live jazz ensembles, entering Cliff Bell’s is like walking onto the set of a Fred Astaire film. The cocktail menu is divided into two categories — Sippers for $12 (a Detroit Dirty Martini, a Gypsy Kiss, Nat’s Niché) or Swizzlers, between $8 and $10 (the Cliff Bell, Cumberland Cup and Ramos Gin Fizz); the menu includes shrimp and grits and frogs’ legs. Dinner costs about $40 with drinks.Sunday 10 a.m.11) A BISTRO BRUNCHAtlas Global Bistro (3111 Woodward Avenue; 313-831-2241; atlasglobalbistro.com), in The Addison — a renovated historic hotel that, like many buildings in Detroit, was designed by the celebrated architect Albert Kahn — serves a memorable brunch: Sweet Shrimp Benny (eggs Benedict with shrimp and spinach), wild rice porridge and Mexican breakfast tacos ($40 for two). 11 a.m.12) GALLERY GAZINGThe Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (4454 Woodward Avenue: 313-832-6622; mocadetroit.org), housed in a former Albert Kahn auto dealership, features contemporary works by international and national artists. The museum’s store, specializing in art and culture magazines and journals, serves as a meeting place for students from the neighboring College for Creative Studies. 1 p.m.13) POTTER’S PARADISEPewabic Pottery (10125 East Jefferson Avenue; 313-822-0954; pewabic.org), is where a renowned type of tile and pottery ware, created by the ceramicist Mary Stratton during the Arts and Crafts movement in 1903, is produced and sold. Now a National Historic Landmark, the building also houses a museum, educational center and store where you can buy a classic Pewabic tile for $24.IF YOU GODeemed the tallest hotel in the world when it opened in 1924, the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit (1114 Washington Boulevard; 313-442-1600; bookcadillacwestin.com) was featured in Frank Capra’s film “State of the Union,” starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Reopened in 2009 after a $200 million renovation, it offers views of the Detroit River and a central location downtown. Doubles from $179.For a more intimate experience try the 40-room Inn on Ferry Street (84 East Ferry Street; 877-784-6835; innonferrystreetdetroit.com), a complex of four historic homes and two carriage houses. Doubles from $129 include breakfast.Urban adventurers should try the brand new Hostel Detroit (2700 Vermont Street; 248-807-2131; hosteldetroit.com) complete with volunteer “ambassadors” ready to show you the sights. Single bunk in an open room is $23 a night.
