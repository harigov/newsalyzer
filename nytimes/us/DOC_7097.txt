“What’s the deal with American politics right now?”This is an odd question for me to try to answer. I write and talk about money, not politics. But this year, it’s the question I hear most often when I travel to other countries. They want to know if I can shed any light on what’s happening in our presidential race.I’m as shocked as everyone else by what is going on. But as I have thought about it, I keep coming back to this great insight from the investing guru Benjamin Graham: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”The same logic holds true for democracy. In the short term, how markets move and whom we elect depends on humans casting ballots in a voting machine – buying stocks or making a choice in the voting booth. The results we see represent nothing more than the collective feelings of all those humans — at that moment. At any given time we’re voting for stocks or politicians based on imperfect information and a very complex set of mental and emotional biases. These are all things that make it incredibly difficult to reach a rational decision.But in the midst of all this angst about what to do or think right now, we can better navigate the messy short term by considering what we want to happen long term. In the long term, we know that markets and elections become the weighing machines that Mr. Graham described. They smooth out the extreme emotions of any one moment and reflect the underlying value of our bigger systems, capitalism and democracy.So we ought to take a step back from what’s happening right now and add some time to our outlook, say 15 to 20 years. We need to find a way to balance the emotion we’re feeling right now with what we’d like to see decades from now. I know that it makes a big difference when it comes to investing, and it stands to reason that it applies to politics, too.When Winston Churchill said, “Democracy is the worst form of government ever created by the mind of man, except for all the others,” he could have been talking about investing in free capital markets, too. All of the fear and risk and volatility add up to the worst possible way to reach financial goals ever created — except for all the others. Still, our investing and electoral systems make more sense when we nudge ourselves into looking past short-term emotions and biases.For instance, it already seems like the race for president has lasted forever. But it hasn’t even been a year since Donald Trump rode down an escalator and ushered in the reality show we’re now watching. We need to remember that in our democratic republic, even a four- or eight-year presidency is still short term.Our country is filled with people experiencing frustration, fear and anger. Why not blow up the whole system? At least it would be entertaining, right? But we owe it to ourselves and to the bigger systems to balance how we’re feeling in the short term against what we’d like to see a decade or two from now.It might help to imagine your personal worst-case situation for 2016. Does a President Trump or Sanders mean you will stop believing in democracy? Probably not. You will still vote in the next election and the one after that because you understand the value of the bigger system. So based on your belief in the bigger system, what’s the best possible vote you can cast this time around?I’m still not sure how to explain what’s happening in American politics. How we’re all feeling now may look nothing like how we feel four years from, even if we are trying to “Trump-proof” our portfolios. In the short term, markets will continue to move, politics will continue to look like a circus and we’ll continue to be human and make decisions based on how we feel. But in the long term, history has proved that both the markets and our political system will stretch to accommodate most of our feelings.
