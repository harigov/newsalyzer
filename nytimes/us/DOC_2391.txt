Dear Diary:To the man in the hard hat on the east side of Eighth Avenue at 32nd Street:It was blustery for May and raining, and I was stumbling down the avenue, washed along by the harried 7 a.m. commuter crowd boiling out of Penn Station.Groggy, juggling coffee and an umbrella, I was leaning into the wind as a fine sheen of sweat built up under my unseasonable sweater.From my left, I heard a tentative voice.“Miss?”There was a gentle tap on my arm.Coming to a stop in the careful way of a New Yorker on a busy sidewalk, I glanced up, a touch curt.“Yes?”You looked down shyly, a young man (21, perhaps?) in a construction worker’s neon vest and hard hat. Your tidy bundle of braids bobbed; you were suddenly embarrassed to make eye contact.For a moment, you didn’t speak. You just stared at your feet. Then, in a low, careful voice, you said: “Your bag. It’s pulling your shorts up in the back.”“Oh.” I tugged at the leg of my shorts. “Thank you.”Your eyes met mine for a moment, and then you moved away, breakfast in a bag in your hand.Maybe you thought I was short with you; maybe you stopped thinking about it the moment you walked away.But our interaction stuck with me all day, as I walked to work and into the office, first one there, putting on the lights. Tugging my shorts down.I had watched you walk into a garage on 31st Street and didn’t properly thank you at the time, so let me thank you now, for your tenderness and sincerity and delicate tap on my arm. Thank you for taking care of strangers.I hope you have daughters one day.
