To the Editor:In “Israel’s War Against George Soros” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, July 18), Mairav Zonszein makes the outrageous claim that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tolerates anti-Semitism.Prime Minister Netanyahu has always condemned anti-Semitism everywhere. George Soros has a consistent record of reckless antipathy toward Israel. In 2011, Mr. Soros absurdly claimed that Israel was the main barrier to democracy in the Middle East. In 2003, he said American and Israeli policies were contributing to anti-Semitism, blaming the victim rather than the culprit.Mr. Soros supports N.G.O.s that libel Israel by falsely accusing it of genocide and war crimes. One N.G.O. Mr. Soros funds wrote the same number of reports from 2000 to 2010 blasting Israel, the one democracy in the Middle East, as it wrote against Iran, Syria and Libya combined.This double standard, not Mr. Soros’s supposed “humanitarianism,” is why many are rightly critical of him. There is no contradiction between speaking honestly about Mr. Soros and simultaneously fighting anti-Semitism wherever and whenever it rears its ugly head.ITAI BARDOV, WASHINGTONThe writer is the spokesman for the Israeli Embassy.
