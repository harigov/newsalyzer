Once a month, Darlene Waters grabs her shopping cart and heads uptown from Chelsea to the Port Authority. Walmart and Sam’s Club beckon, just a bus ride away in Secaucus, N.J. “Right now, they are my two favorite stores,” she said.Ms. Waters doesn’t lack for shops in her neighborhood. But the marinara sauce her grandson likes — Paul Newman’s — goes for “$4 and some change” in Chelsea, she says, about double what it costs across the river. The same goes for toothpaste, rotisserie chicken, mozzarella for her baked ziti. And never mind cake. At Harbs, a bakery that opened last year on Ninth Avenue, a slice of strawberry cake goes for $10.Ms. Waters, 70, a retired assistant nursery school teacher, lives in public housing, so at least she can afford her rent. But her surroundings have undergone a dizzying economic transformation in the past two to three decades, with an influx of wealth affecting the residents of less means in both obvious and insidious ways. And that change shows no signs of slowing.“The area is much more beautiful than when I was coming up,” said Ms. Waters, who has lived in Chelsea since she was 11. “We have all sorts of people we can learn from. The big problem is money.”Today’s Chelsea, the swath west of Avenue of the Americas between 14th and 34th Streets, could be the poster neighborhood for what Mayor Bill de Blasio calls the tale of two cities. While the average household income in Chelsea has climbed exponentially, the income at Elliot Houses, the housing project where Ms. Waters lives, has remained more or less steady.Census and city figures show that the average household income in Chelsea, about $140,000, is almost five times the average for households in public housing in the area. The neighborhood now ranks among those in the city with the greatest income inequality, according to the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, as the share of households in the highest income brackets — over $250,000 — has grown.With hyper-gentrification has come hyper-anxiety, and not just in Chelsea. The administration of Mayor de Blasio, a Democrat, plans to rezone parts of the city to build both affordable and market-rate housing, spurring passionate protests in East New York and other corners of the city where residents worry that the envisioned development will end up displacing poor, longtime tenants.And the mayor’s plan to generate more revenue for the New York City Housing Authority, known as Nycha, by leasing land within housing projects for mixed-income housing has fueled longstanding fears that public housing buildings may ultimately be steamrollered by the hot real estate market — privatized or demolished to make room for richer New Yorkers.“Is Nycha giving up public housing?” a resident of Wyckoff Gardens in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, one of the housing projects where some of the new housing will be built, asked at a meeting this month of residents with officials from the agency.“Are we guaranteed that people here will keep their apartment?” asked another.In long-gentrified Chelsea, the worst fears have yet to come true. The housing projects — Fulton Houses (between 16th and 19th Streets and Ninth and 10th Avenues) and the neighboring Elliot and Chelsea Houses (in the mid-20s) — with about 2,000 apartments combined, are still there, as they have been since the 1940s (Elliot) and ’60s (Fulton and Chelsea). The brick buildings have deteriorated, however, under the weight of time and as the Housing Authority’s maintenance budget has fallen short, although city officials say they remain committed to preserving public housing. And the neighborhood around them has metamorphosed into an area of luxury apartment towers, renovated storefronts and offices, and spectacular public spaces, like the High Line, leaving some public housing residents feeling both lucky and doomed.Barbara Sanchez, 42, who grew up at Fulton Houses during Chelsea’s unsavory history of rampant drug-dealing and prostitution on some streets, still marvels that she can let her 11-year-old daughter walk a few blocks home from school on her own, or that they can visit parks she once shunned.“You could not walk in the park because of drugs,” she said of a small park on 17th Street. “Now, people lunch, jog through, and people are sitting out with their Mac.”A report commissioned by the city and released in May studied the effects of gentrification on public housing residents and found benefits like safer streets and higher performing schools and students for those in wealthier settings. Coexistence, the researchers found, also led to higher annual earnings for public housing households in high-income areas than their counterparts in poor neighborhoods.But there were downsides.“The residents felt profound anxiety,” said Ingrid Gould Ellen, director of the Furman Center and principal investigator of the study, of which Abt Associates was co-author.“They appreciated the safety but they felt a loss, and daily expenses were greater and they felt great alienation.”In interviews, residents noted that gone were the old mom-and-pop stores, the bodegas, the low-rise buildings and the gathering spots, replaced with higher-end substitutes. Old standbys like lunch counters and delis, inexpensive fishmongers and butchers, laundromats and convenience stores have grown scarcer, or disappeared altogether, amid the proliferation of multimillion-dollar condos, tech companies like Google and fancy restaurants imbuing the area with the ambience of the meatpacking district to the south.Contrasts abound. On one block, yellow school buses line up on Ninth Avenue at pickup time in front of Public School 33. A block away on 10th Avenue, a parade of Cadillac Escalade S.U.V.s do the same in front of Avenues: The World School, a prekindergarten-to-12th-grade private school that opened in 2012, where annual tuition is $44,000.As the old Western Beef supermarket turned into the Apple store with the glass staircase, and the pizza place into an eyebrow salon, many residents said they had lost a sense of belonging.Ms. Sanchez spoke of the loss of an ethnic enclave when most residents of the area were from Puerto Rico, where her parents came from. Now, she said, she travels to Delancey Street on the Lower East Side to shop for her Puerto Rican dishes as she tries to impart her culture to her daughter and 13-year-old son.Juwan Stone, a resident of Elliot Houses who aspires to become an actor, spoke of sometimes overwhelming change.“All the attention is on the businesses,” he said. “You walk past a scaffold and you wonder, What are they going to build now?”The neighborhood feels welcoming in varying degrees, Mr. Stone said. He has worked summer jobs in the High Line park nearby and said he and his friends appreciated the free concerts and other entertainment the park offered. But he said some upscale retailers around him were “stores I feel would be uncomfortable to go in.”The struggle with affordability has left some young people in public housing knowing that their neighborhood will not be theirs for long. Ms. Waters’s grandson, Justin Waters, 27, a computer systems analyst for the Hudson Guild, a community agency, said he did not see himself staying in Chelsea despite the advantages of the location. “Every single year, prices increase,” he said. “You shouldn’t constantly struggle to live somewhere. At that point you’re not even enjoying it.”The chasm between the market rents and what is affordable for most in public housing would preclude even the upwardly mobile in the projects from staying in the neighborhood when they seek to move to private housing. Even former newcomers once viewed as gentrifiers have been priced out.Art galleries, which came to the scene starting in the 1990s, have been closing or leaving for cheaper rents, said Councilman Corey Johnson, a Democrat who represents Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen and the West Village. “A ton of small independent art galleries are fleeing to the Lower East Side and Brooklyn because building owners are asking exorbitantly more in west Chelsea,” he said.Despite a construction boom — Chelsea had the highest number of residential units authorized by new building permits by 2014, according to the Furman Center — the rental supply hasn’t kept up with demand. The median asking rent was $3,490 in 2014, the fourth highest in the city, officials at the center said.Public housing is not the only low- and middle-income stronghold. Penn South, a major cooperative of middle-income housing with more than 2,800 apartments, and the rent-regulated apartment stock also help Chelsea maintain economic diversity.But the city has lost many more rent-regulated apartments than have been built over the last two decades, especially now in areas like Chelsea, where market rents are high enough to enable landlords under the state rent law to take apartments out of regulation when there are vacancies.“The huge loss in rent-regulated units, paired with an influx of luxury rentals, leaves families with few options to stay in their community,” said Barika Williams, deputy director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development.The ever-rising market rates for both homes and businesses have also driven out Chelsea’s once thriving gay community, Mr. Johnson said, citing the departure of gay clubs like Rawhide.“Chelsea has become much less gay,” said Mr. Johnson, who is gay. “People started moving to Hell’s Kitchen, and now people are going to the outer boroughs.”Mr. Johnson, who lived in Massachusetts public housing while growing up, said he, too, had been affected by higher housing costs. In 2003, he lived in a studio for $900 a month. Five years ago, he moved to another studio across the street where monthly rent was $1,750. He currently pays nearly $1,000 more — $2,700 — for the same 319-square-foot unit.As government-subsidized tenants, public housing residents are protected by a federal policy that requires them to pay no more than 30 percent of their income in rent. But the fear of displacement persists nevertheless. Three years ago, the city took a parking lot from Elliot and Chelsea Houses to build 168 apartments for low-to-middle-income households, and it now plans another affordable building, at a parking lot and compactor yard at Fulton Houses, Housing Authority officials said.“It’d be stupid not to think that, because eventually it will happen,” Ms. Sanchez, of Fulton Houses, said. “A company may say, we have enough to buy Nycha out. There’s somebody out there who’s probably saying, ‘How do we do this,’ because it’s prime real estate.”As ZIP codes get richer, there are other consequences.Mr. Johnson noted that he did not get as much discretionary money to spend as his Council counterparts representing poorer districts.In 2012, the Hudson Guild, which operates on Nycha grounds and at other sites, lost half its day-care program when the Bloomberg administration based funding for free and low-cost child care programs on area income, said Ken Jockers, the guild’s executive director. (The Council restored the money, he said, and the center eventually won a federal Head Start grant to continue the program.)“A ZIP code analysis doesn’t account for block-by-block nuances,” Mr. Jockers said. “Even now, when the city looks at low-income neighborhoods in the city, which informs so much of city policy, that often disregards the fact that if you’re a poor person in Chelsea, you’re just as poor as the person living in Bushwick.”Some Chelsea businesses have tried to bridge the divide. Mr. Jockers said the fashion company Tommy Hilfiger USA and IAC/Interactive Corporation, the Internet media conglomerate controlled by Barry Diller, have made multiyear, five- and six-figure money commitments to the guild’s programs, which mostly serve public housing residents and also draw volunteers and mentors from local companies.The Avenues school, which opened in a renovated warehouse and currently serves 1,229 students, mostly from outside the neighborhood, gives nearly $1 million in financial aid to 35 students from its community board district, officials at the school said. They said the school moved to Chelsea looking for a large space and offerings that could enrich the student experience, like the sports facilities at Chelsea Piers, the High Line and the arts scene.The officials promise more aid as Avenues expands to a second building nearby in 2018, and it has just created a position for someone to work full time on community engagement. “It’s based on our belief that our students will learn more by being part of our community,” said Gardner Dunnan, the academic dean.To expand Chelsea Market, the food and office complex on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets, Jamestown Properties negotiated with the city a pledge of more than $1 million over four years for a technology training program for public housing youth so they can compete for jobs in the area, as well as $12 million for the High Line and about $5 million for a fund to build affordable housing.But jobs for local residents have not materialized to the extent expected, residents and local officials said. “When you have some of the best known, best paying companies in the United States located in Chelsea,” said Councilman Johnson, “it’d be ideal to try to get young people who are from low-income families to offer paid internships, job training and jobs to get them involved so they could stay in the neighborhood they grew up in.”More wealth is coming. At the northern edge of Chelsea, the huge new development known as Hudson Yards is rising, with 5,000 luxury apartments, designer stores, new parks and a hotel, continuing the area’s trend toward affluence.Back in a more modest New York, Ms. Waters gets her hair done at a beauty school on 34th Street for $15, and alternates among three restaurants she can afford for the occasional meal out. As the vice-president of the tenants’ association at Elliot Houses and president of the Hudson Guild’s neighborhood advisory committee, she is now working with other residents to rent a van or a bus in November for a holiday shopping trip to New Jersey. In between cross-state trips, she studies shoppers and saves coupons before she hunts for deals closer to home.But on balance, she said, “I’d rather have Chelsea as it is today.”“There’s more people,” she said. “It’s brighter, it’s beautiful, it’s more inviting than it used to be. We’re very lucky to be able to stay in housing that hopefully will not disappear.”
