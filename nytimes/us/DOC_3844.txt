For T’s ongoing series, stage director and artist Robert Wilson responds to Anne Carson’s fragmented jottings from a theater rehearsal room with an intriguing found object.NOTES FOR MEETING WITH THE ACTORS THE DAY THE DIRECTOR ASKED ME TO COME TO FIRST ‘ANTIGONICK’ READ-THROUGHSaying who we all are to each other.Pronounce the Greek names.Do not put size into how you use the words simple and dry keep drying it out.Chewing is good but dry.No punctuation much gives alacrity.Snappy but not too fast to have the thought.What the chorus is for? no idea explore the underlying morbidity let it be a guywho’s seen it all before how it quiets him shakingly almost incantatory.Fun language meat language the shift.Get into the logic battle of K and A her reasons murkier her ready for actionreasoning is an action.Nightwithiningness.Is it Hegel who disapproves.Skip Hegel she does by putting her foot in the fire.‘‘There were things under things and things inside things’’ (H.D. to Freud).Quoting Hegel again is it a question.How manipulative H is how terrified find the size of the language.A wants the glory she is too much.The bravura of the pastry sorry poetry (not logic).If it’s past ten to three we don’t need to do the whole exodos do we.— ANNE CARSON
