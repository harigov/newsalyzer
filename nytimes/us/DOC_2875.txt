First there were the glowing reviews. Then came a barrage of hate mail.“What hurt was that it was from my own people,” the designer Willy Chavarria said on Wednesday, referring to his much-discussed men’s wear show last February.“Brown Power” was the title of that politically charged post-inauguration presentation, one inspired by the people Mr. Chavarria grew up around in the San Joaquin Valley in California.The unknown models Mr. Chavarria used for that show — held during the previous edition of New York Fashion Week: Men’s — included a Honduran delivery man and a young trans woman. And what proved most troubling for Mr. Chavarria, who is gay, was the unprintably homophobic language used by his fellow Latinos to accuse him of casting the larger community in an unflattering light.“It made me think about the oppression that exists within communities that are already marginalized,” he said.Stung, but undaunted, Mr. Chavarria, 50, chose another hot-button political issue — that of cultural appropriation — for “Cruising,” a poetic follow-up that managed to wed the aesthetics of two cultures that could hardly be less alike: lowriders and the gay leather-bar scene.“I wanted to use my past and the beautiful things that emerged from growing up around Chicano culture,” said the designer, the only child of a Mexican father and an Irish-American mother. He also deployed stylistic elements of a leather scene he was never part of but admired from afar.Thus, his spring collection, staged at the Eagle — a venerable gay leather bar in Chelsea, whose first outpost opened in 1970 — took and twisted elements of lowrider style (crisp oversize shirts; shoulders dropped and ornamented with ruching; skirt-wide khakis cinched tight with karate belting; tracksuits with satin inlays; spotless Florsheims) and fused them to the big black biker jackets, grommet belts and peaked leather caps no self-respecting leather daddy would be without.Collaborating with a childhood friend, the artist Brian Calvin, Mr. Chavarria subverted classic American logos like those for Marlboros and Coors Light to read “American Mayhem” and “Cares Fight.”
