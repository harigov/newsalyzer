This sentence describes a common but slightly disorienting experience: seeing the moon in the still-bright daytime sky. It happens all the time. The sun and moon don’t trade off mechanically, as we have been taught by nursery mobiles and cuckoo clocks. For some portion of nearly every day, they occupy the sky together, and a pale version of the moon (as Durga Chew-Bose puts it: ‘‘the moon’s hazy thumbprint’’) sits up there, absurdly, in a field of blue.This is a result of basic astronomy: the way rocks swing around balls of gas and the patterns of light they leave in our sky. Any given place on earth spends roughly 12 hours a day facing the sun, and 12 in view of the moon, and those hours often overlap. Humans, however, have always had a mania for investing blunt astronomical facts with imagination. The lights in the sky are too familiar not to give them stories.The daytime moon has always struck me as a little sad: weak, diminished, out of place. When my daughter was small, we used to laugh at it. It had become confused, I told her, and wandered out when it wasn’t supposed to. Silly moon! It seemed embarrassed, not quite ready to be seen, perhaps even trying to sneak away — only to be exposed, cruelly, by the light of day.But I prefer Chew-Bose’s version: the daytime moon as empowered and impish. It doesn’t drift through the sky neutrally or accidentally or reluctantly. It is enjoying itself up there, messing with the arrogant day, which so clearly wants to be thought of as primary, sovereign, robust, commanding. The daytime moon debunks it. It is an astronomical photobomb. What you think you are seeing is not the only thing to see. Things change. Night is coming.
