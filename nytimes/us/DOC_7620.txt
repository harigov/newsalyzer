AUSTIN, Tex. — One way to guarantee a strong reaction to the opening scene of your action comedy? Feature a slow-motion kitten.A cute cat runs through a drug-related gunfight in “Keanu,” the first film in which the comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, a.k.a. Key and Peele, share top billing. South by Southwest fans got a sneak peek at the film at a midnight screening over the weekend.The sketches from the stars’ Comedy Central show, which frequently approached absurdity, often took on a life of their own online, generating hundreds of millions of YouTube views.So it was interesting to see how a real-life audience outside of the digital, shareable realm would respond to the team’s work.Before the screening, the two introduced the movie armed with stuffed kittens to throw into the crowd.Mr. Key said, “This is the work-in-progress screening of ‘Keanu,’ which basically means, if you like it, good, that’s the movie. If you don’t, we’re changing it so hard.”Mr. Peele added, “If you don’t like it, it’s just going to be ‘John Wick 2.’”Initially the audience laughed heartily at jokes stemming from that star-worthy kitten, and various gags involving the actors as none-too-streetwise characters pretending to be gangsters. But the energy in the room didn’t stay as lively throughout and there were some lulls. A late screening time may have contributed, but the early reviews were mixed.Justin Chang at Variety called it “initially amusing but fatally overstretched.” Eric Kohn at Indiewire said the movie “returns to variations of the same punchlines again and again.” However, John DeFore at The Hollywood Reporter called it a “consistently funny action-comedy.”The finished film opens nationwide April 29.
