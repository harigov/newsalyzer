WASHINGTON —  As the Senate moves closer to a Sunday night showdown over whether it will let Patriot Act surveillance powers expire on Monday, supporters and critics of how the government has used those authorities have been using increasingly alarming language.But there is little evidence in the history of the expiring laws — including the one that the government uses to justify the once-secret National Security Agency program that vacuums up Americans’ phone records in bulk — to support the arguments that either side is making.Republican senators who want to keep the program are warning that any lapse in “this critical tool would lead to attacks on the United States,” as Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, recently put it. Yet throughout the program’s existence, it has never thwarted a terrorist attack, studies and testimony show.At the same time, proponents of ending the program say it poses risks to Americans’ private lives, by permitting the government to know who has been calling psychiatrists or political groups, for example. But despite the discovery of technical violations of the rules several years ago, no evidence has emerged that the program has been misused for political or personal gain. As a result, the privacy-minded critics have had to couch their warnings in hypothetical terms.“Even if we stipulate for purposes of this discussion that no one within the N.S.A. is currently abusing this program for nefarious political purposes,” Senator Rand Paul, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, said in a filibuster-style floor speech last week, “can we say we are certain that will always be the case? Who is to say what might happen one year from now, two years from now, five years, 10 years or 15 years from now?”Three counterterrorism laws are set to expire on Monday, and the Senate fell three votes short of moving forward with the replacement legislation before the Memorial Day break.Of the three laws, the one that has attracted the greatest attention is Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which permits the F.B.I. to get court orders to collect business records that are relevant to a national security investigation.It has had both an ordinary use — allowing agents to get specific records, like Internet activity logs of a suspect, which they used about 160 times last year — and an extraordinary one, the bulk phone records program.The House has already passed a bill called the USA Freedom Act. It would extend the three expiring laws but end the bulk phone records program, replacing it with one in which the government could still analyze links between callers to hunt for terrorists but would keep the bulk records in the hands of phone companies.Opponents of ending the current program, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have made some arguments that are supported by evidence. They complain, accurately, that the current program keeps the records for five years, while under the envisioned replacement, the phone companies might delete them after 18 months.But they have also portrayed the importance of the program — which began in October 2001 and was brought under Section 215 of the Patriot Act in 2006 — in terms that appear overstated in light of its historic performance.For example, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent agency created by Congress, studied classified reports about how the program had been used and what the government considered to be its greatest success stories. The board found no instances in which it had been abused, but also none in which it stopped a terrorist attack.“We found on a number of metrics, including thwarting plots and identifying terrorist activity, the program had not proven to be successful,” David Medine, the board chairman, said Thursday. “It has some minor benefits that could have been accomplished through other legal means.”Its most concrete accomplishment, according to the group’s report, was leading the F.B.I. to scrutinize a San Diego man who turned out to have donated several thousand dollars to the Shabab, the Islamist group in Somalia. There was no accusation that he was planning to commit any terrorist attack.Still, government officials say the program has helped them in less tangible ways, including by providing peace of mind when investigators uncover a new terrorism-linked phone number and see that it has not been in direct or indirect contact with anyone in the United States.The program was also studied by a review group appointed by President Obama to study surveillance policies, which included Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor. The review group concluded that the program had not done much but said that its capabilities were worth preserving if the risks to privacy could be reduced.“The thing about this program is that it is perfectly logical,” Mr. Stone said Thursday. “It may be that it will, in fact, enable the government to prevent a terrorist attack. The fact that it hasn’t in the past six years doesn’t mean it won’t in the next six years.”That kind of calibrated assessment, however, is increasingly absent from the political debate over the expiring laws.The Obama administration has also begun heating up its own language in support of the USA Freedom Act.Focusing on the prospect that the three laws may lapse, even for ordinary uses, if the Senate opponents to the bill do not give in, a White House spokesman last week called the opponents “grossly irresponsible” for risking “critically important” tools. On Wednesday, an administration official told reporters that if lawmakers allowed the laws to expire they would be playing “national security Russian roulette.”But one of the three expiring laws, which permits national security wiretaps of “lone wolf” terrorists who are not affiliated with a group, has apparently never been used. Another, which permits wiretaps that follow a suspect as he changes phones, is used only rarely.The third — Section 215 — is a useful tool but has not provided any crucial breakthroughs, according to a recently released Justice Department inspector general report.“The agents we interviewed did not identify any major case developments that resulted from the records obtained in response to Section 215 orders, but told us the authority is valuable when it is the only means to obtain certain information,” the report said.
