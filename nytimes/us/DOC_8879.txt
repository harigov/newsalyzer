Today’s malls increasingly seem like an endangered species, as the excitement of department store shopping gives way to sealing the deal online with the click of a button.The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., which still bills itself as “one of the top tourist destinations in the country,” is nevertheless determined to promote its 25th anniversary with a distinctly old-fashioned gambit.It’s naming a writer-in-residence.The residency idea has caught on at a number of corporations and commercial places, like Heathrow Airport in London, as a way to raise brand awareness.Amtrak has run such a program for the past three years, offering “creative professionals who are passionate about train travel” round-trip tickets on a long-distance route and the use of a private sleeping roomette, “equipped with a desk, a bed and a window to watch the American countryside.”Not all the musings of these residents have been as bucolic as one might expect. Rachel Monroe of Marfa, Tex., wrote of her experience on Twitter:(A fatal accident involving a train was reported in Fresno, Calif., that day.)The Mall, for its part, is inviting “a special scribe” to “spend five days deeply immersed in the mall atmosphere while writing on-the-fly impressions in their own words.”Before midnight Central time on March 10, applicants can submit their pitch in 150 or fewer words, after which 25 semifinalists will be invited to expand on their ideas in a 500- to 800-word essay.“Would it be a personal story? A blow-by-blow account of your experiences? The mall as seen through the eyes of a first-time tourist or a regular guest?” the contest asks. “Heck, if you can make the assignment work as a musical-comedy screenplay, by all means make it so!”The goal of the contest, according to the mall’s news release cited by The Star Tribune, “is to come away from this project with an evocative story about Mall of America that represents the contemporary guest experience after 25 years of evolution as a leading retail and entertainment establishment.”Of course.The winner will be treated to a four-night hotel stay, a $400 gift card for food and drinks and a $2,500 honorarium “for the sweat and tears they’ll put into their prose.”Might audiences soon be flocking to Broadway for “Mall of America: The Musical”? Then again, you could just be an artist-in-residence for the National Park Service and commit to canvas your impressions of sites like Joshua Tree and Mount Rushmore.
