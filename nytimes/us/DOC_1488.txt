Around the world, up to 2,000 cases of plague are still reported to the World Health Organization every year, and the ancient disease remains a fearsome threat in many countries, especially in Africa. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently developed a quick test to help diagnose plague that has shown promising results.The test kit consists of a plague “dipstick” that works much like a pregnancy test. A blood sample infected with Yersinia pestis turns an indicator color, enabling a rural clinician to begin administering the antibiotics that are effective in controlling the disease. Without this quick test, it might take days for a blood sample to get to a laboratory to be analyzed, delaying the start of treatment.The plague dipstick is being field-tested in Uganda, where plague is endemic and can spread quickly. The C.D.C. has worked with local clinicians and traditional tribal healers to identify plague. In one case last October, a 27-year old farmer came down with high fever and the telltale swelling, or bubo, linked to plague. A tribal healer trained by the C.D.C. referred him to a local clinic, and the dipstick test administered there confirmed the plague. He was treated immediately and within a day, his fever was gone.“The difference between life and death for someone with plague can be a matter of hours,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C.A single dipstick costs less than a dollar to make. Dr. Frieden said the instrument was in trials, but if approved by the Food and Drug Administration it could be used here in the United States as well as in Africa.
