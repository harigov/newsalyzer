PORTSMOUTH, Va. — A white former police officer was convicted of voluntary manslaughter on Thursday in the shooting death of an unarmed black man who had been accused of shoplifting.Hours after convicting the ex-officer, Stephen Rankin, the jury recommended that he serve two and a half years in prison in the death of William Chapman, who was shot in the face and chest outside a Walmart in April 2015 after a security guard called police.No video recorded the actual killing, and testimony conflicted on the details. But most witnesses, including the security guard who called in the shoplifting report, said Mr. Chapman, 18, had his hands up when he was shot, and the prosecutor, Stephanie Morales, said Officer Rankin could have used nondeadly force.The officer “brought a gun into what is at worst a fistfight,” Ms. Morales told the jury, which deliberated for nearly two days before returning its verdict. Many residents of Portsmouth, a mostly black city of 100,000, saw his trial as a chance for accountability as police shootings generate protests around the country.Mr. Rankin, who had killed another unarmed suspect four years ago, was dismissed from the Portsmouth police force after his indictment in the Chapman case. He had faced one to 10 years in prison.Ms. Morales asked jurors to give Mr. Rankin “the 10 years that he deserves.” The defense lawyer, James Broccolletti, argued that incarceration would serve no purpose and urged against prison.
