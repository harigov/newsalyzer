Summer is all about dashing through sprinklers, hiking into forests, and charging toward waves. Therefore the best summer foods — like fried chicken, hamburgers and corn on the cob — are all portable, hand-held and free from fuss. We want to munch while experiencing the joys of the season.For dessert, nothing fits the bill better than the classic ice cream sandwich.Designer ice cream sandwiches, made with amped-up cookies, fancy sprinkles and crazy flavors, can be tasty, but the classic combination of a chocolate base and vanilla ice cream pleases everyone who finds it in hand.The pairing is basic, and so it is imperative that each element be lovely, a feat accomplished by making at least one of them from scratch.The chocolate layers should have an addictive texture and taste of real chocolate. This version uses cocoa powder for a clean, pleasant flavor, and has a delightful chewiness, like the sought-after edges of a perfect brownie. Instead of a crunchy cookie, these cake layers are fudgy and soft enough to yield easily with each bite. (Errant ice cream squishing out the other end would be a disappointment and a distraction.) Baking one thin cake in a rimmed baking sheet, then cutting it in half, makes the process of filling enough sandwiches for a crowd easy and efficient.Choose a good-quality ice cream to complete your sandwiches. If you aren’t making your own, look for a premium brand with a high butterfat content and less air to ensure a harder freeze and a slower melt, as well as a luxurious mouthfeel and heavenly texture.Recipes: Ice Cream Sandwiches | How to Make Ice CreamFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
