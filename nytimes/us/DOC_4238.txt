With a 14-year drought in the Colorado River basin showing few signs of breaking, states along the river’s path are taking new steps this month to ensure that Lake Mead — the Colorado River reservoir that is the water source for much of the Southwest — does not fail them.Officials from water agencies in Arizona, California and Nevada signed an agreement last week to jointly add as much as three million acre-feet of water to Lake Mead by 2020, mostly through conservation and changes in water management that would reduce the amount that the states draw from the lake.The agreement, signed at the Colorado River Water Users Association’s annual conference in Las Vegas, is aimed at forestalling further drops in the level of the lake that could endanger not just the water supply for 40 million people, but also the electricity generated by dams there and upstream at Lake Powell.Three million acre-feet, roughly what six million households use in a year, would add about 30 feet of water to a lake whose level is now just a few feet above its record low.The agreement is a stopgap solution that is unlikely to solve the problems of a region whose demand for water far exceeds what the Colorado is able to deliver.Many outsiders have suggested that the drought could set off a legal battle over the allocation of the Colorado’s dwindling water that could reach the Supreme Court. But for now, at least, the states appear to have decided to share the pain.“The fact of the matter is that we work together,” said Chuck Cullom, the Colorado River programs manager for the Central Arizona Project, a web of canals whose diversions of the Colorado’s water have helped fuel the state’s rapid growth. “A direct and open conflict may create more risk and uncertainty than working collaboratively.”Arizona, in particular, has a reason to fight. In the 1960s, it bartered away its senior rights to Colorado water to get California’s support in Congress for the Central Arizona Project.Should Lake Mead run short, Arizona’s share of water would be rationed while California would continue to drink its fill — a prospect that has rankled Arizonans for decades.Much of the seven-state Colorado River basin is gripped by a hydrological drought, a long-term precipitation deficit that has slashed stream flows, soil moisture and groundwater levels. Experts say the drought is the worst in centuries.The level of Lake Mead, now about 40 percent full, is only about 10 feet above the point at which the federal government would declare a shortage and begin rationing water to downstream users. That prospect seemed remote only a few years ago, but the federal Bureau of Reclamation now predicts that it could occur as soon as spring of 2016, and is likely in 2017.A further 25-foot drop would dry up one of two water intakes that supply 70 percent of Nevada’s population with water.The agreement comes amid a flurry of activity by Colorado River states to ensure access to their share of the river’s water amid the drought.Only last week, Nevada workers completed a three-mile, $817 million tunnel into the lower reaches of Lake Mead, giving the state a steady water source should a declining lake level disable intakes at higher elevations.At the same time, the Southern Nevada Water Authority approved plans to spend $680 million to build a pumping station for the same intake — a recognition that falling lake levels could render useless the existing pumps higher up Lake Mead’s basin.Colorado issued a draft water plan this month that calls for conservation efforts and construction of reservoirs to cope with rising demand — and leaves open the possibility that eastern Colorado will pump more Colorado River water over the Rocky Mountains to supply the state’s more populous east.Last week, Wyoming released the findings of research into what may be the most unusual of all the efforts to resuscitate the Colorado: cloud seeding.With financial help from Arizona, California and Nevada, Wyoming has seeded snow clouds for a decade, hoping to build a snowpack that will deliver more water to the Colorado and its tributaries in the spring.Scientists have long been skeptical that seeding clouds with certain chemicals actually works; the National Research Council concluded in 2003 that while the process clearly changes the character of clouds, there was no proof that it produced more precipitation.But the Wyoming study found that snowfall increased by as much as 15 percent after clouds were seeded, and that the added snow increased stream flows by as much as 3.7 percent. The research found that cloud seeding could cost as little as $27 per acre-foot of water — or as much as $427 per acre-foot. But even the higher cost is lower than that of desalination, an alternative to using Colorado River water that is being considered in some states.All of the Colorado River basin states except Arizona have cloud-seeding programs, sometimes financed in part by downstream states that are the biggest water users.
