WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an appeal from Samsung on what it must pay Apple for infringing on part of the design of the iPhone. In a brief supporting Samsung, companies including Google and Facebook said the legal framework governing the design patents at issue was “out of step with modern technology.”Samsung, the Korean electronics company, argued that design patents, which address what products look like, are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties.Design patents once covered household items like spoons and fireplace grates — whose design was central to the product — and a finding of infringement required the defendant to turn over all of its profits. Samsung argued that this “total profit rule” did not make sense in the digital era and would “reward design patents far beyond the value of any inventive contribution.”“In other words,” the company’s brief said, “even if the patented features contributed 1 percent of the value of Samsung’s phones, Apple gets 100 percent of Samsung’s profits.”Design patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.In December, Samsung agreed to pay Apple $548 million in damages in the case, but it reserved the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. The company now stands to recover as much as $399 million of that, representing its total profits from various models of phones that Apple said, in a lawsuit filed in 2011, infringed on its design patents.A Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, said in a statement that the court’s review “could lead to a fair interpretation of patent law that will support creativity and reward innovation.” Apple declined to comment.The three design elements at issue in the case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung’s description, “a particular black rectangular round-cornered front face”; “a substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim”; and “a particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.”In urging the Supreme Court not to hear the case, Apple said the justices should not reward a copycat.“The iPhone’s explosive success was due in no small part to its innovative design, which included a distinctive front face and a colorful graphical user interface — features protected by U.S. design patents,” the company’s brief said. “The innovation and beauty of Apple’s designs were not only hailed by consumers and the press, but envied by Apple’s fiercest competitor, Samsung, which by its executive’s own admission in related litigation is a ‘fast follower’ rather than an innovator.”The justices agreed to decide only one of the questions on which Samsung had sought review: “Where a design patent is applied to only a component of a product, should an award of infringer’s profits be limited to those profits attributable to the component?”Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court that handles patent appeals, ruled that the governing statute “explicitly authorizes the award of total profit from the article of manufacture bearing the patented design.”The court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that “an award of a defendant’s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.” But it added that “those are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.”“We are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,” the court said.David Opderbeck, a law professor at Seton Hall University, said the justices had focused on an important issue.“The key question is whether damages relating to a design patent should be apportioned in relation to the value added by the patented design or can cover the infringer’s entire profit on the infringing product,” he said.“The Federal Circuit read the design patent law very literally and held that the entire profits can be recovered,” he added. “In my opinion, this is a far too literal reading of the statute, particularly because a product’s ornamental design very often is not the primary driver of consumer demand and of the manufacturer’s profits. In some ways, the Federal Circuit’s ruling could allow design patent law to swallow utility patent law, making the ornamental design more important than the underlying technology.”
