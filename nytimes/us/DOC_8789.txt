The brainchild of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, New York Fashion Week: Men’s is entering its fifth season. This time around, more than 50 brands will show their spring 2018 collections in the hopes of winning the attention of editors and retail executives as Lower Manhattan becomes a playground for dandies and fops and the street-style photographers who track them.While the majority of the big brands and luxury houses are content to display their wares in Milan and Paris, the New York iteration of men’s fashion week has become known for its emphasis on scrappy brands from all over the world.Bruce Pask, the men’s director at Bergdorf Goodman, predicts that there will be lots of easy sportswear at the runway shows and presentations. “That’s always going to be a significant portion of what’s shown here,” Mr. Pask said. “The casual lifestyle and the clothing that goes along with that is an American creation.”The New York event follows a month of men’s wear shows in London, Paris, Milan and Florence, Italy. While attending those events, Mr. Pask noticed a few changes reflecting a refocusing on proportion likely to be on view here. “We’re looking at clothing that is bigger, a bit more fluid,” he said. “Pants that are full, shorts that are oversized, referencing late ’80s early ’90s fashion, but it’s interpreted.”Here, we take a quick look at the shows scheduled from July 10 through 14. All events take place at Skylight Clarkson Square in West SoHo unless otherwise noted.Todd SnyderThe no-nonsense American designer Todd Snyder has the prime-time slot on Day 1 with a 7 p.m. fashion show followed by an 8 p.m. kickoff party catered by Nicholas Morgenstern of the El Rey. July 10, 7 p.m., Cadillac House, 330 Hudson StreetRaf SimonsJust because the Belgian designer Raf Simons serves as the chief creative officer of Calvin Klein does not mean he doesn’t have time for his own brand.

July 11, 9 p.m., location unknown at time of publication.Willy ChavarriaWilly Chavarria has found inspiration for his new collection in the Eagle, a Chelsea leather bar.

July 11, 7 p.m.Ovadia & SonsIn the seven years of their label’s existence, the boys (Shimon and Ariel Ovadia) from Brooklyn have become hometown heroes and a favorite of athletes and the hip-hop set with collections that find a happy medium between streetwear cool and preppy.

Swiader: The soft draping of Raf Swiader’s materials are at the heart of a men’s wear brand that aims to fulfill a “utilitarian lifestyle” (his words). Descendant of Thieves: Specializing in shirts and knit tops, the staples designed by Dres Ladro and Matteo Maniatty carry a whiff of their Mediterranean heritage. Heliot Emil: The Copenhagen brand is drastically minimalist and impertinently unisex.
