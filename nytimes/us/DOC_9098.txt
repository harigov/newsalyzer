HONG KONG —  The authorities in Xinjiang, the ethnically divided region in far western China, said on Saturday that eight people had been executed on charges related to separatist violence, including an attack last year in which a car plowed through tourists near Tiananmen Square in Beijing and erupted in flames.The executions were the latest in a succession of displays of might and resolve by the Chinese government, which is trying to extinguish increasingly violent discontent among Uighurs in Xinjiang, their homeland, where they now form a minority of the population.Tianshan, the official news service for Xinjiang, said that China’s highest court had in recent days approved the execution of eight people on charges stemming from five separate cases and that the death sentences had been carried out under the supervision of local courts. The report was widely publicized by Chinese state news media and accompanied by television footage that showed suspects in handcuffs and shackles under interrogation.The reports did not give the ethnicity of the executed men, but their distinctive names indicated that they were Uighur, a Turkic-speaking people who mostly follow Sunni Islam. Their crimes included “organizing, leading and participating in a terror organization; intentional homicide; arson; illegally making, storing and transporting explosives; and jeopardizing public safety by dangerous means,” the Tianshan report said.Three of the men who were executed “masterminded” an attack last October, in which three bystanders were killed and 39 others were injured when a sport utility vehicle rammed through a crowd near Tiananmen Square before it burst into flames, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. Three people inside the vehicle also died.The other prisoners executed included Rozi Eziz, convicted of seizing a gun in June 2013 and firing at two police officers in Aksu, Xinjiang; and Abdusalam Elim, convicted of “organizing and leading” a terrorist organization and making explosives, Xinhua said.The reports did not say when or how the death sentences were carried out.Human rights groups and advocates of Uighur self-determination have argued that the Chinese government’s pervasive controls on Uighurs have exacerbated, rather than reduced, tensions in Xinjiang. Many Uighurs resent the growing Han ethnic population in Xinjiang, as well as increasing government restrictions on dress, religious life, travel and language.Xinjiang came under Chinese Communist control in 1949, and ethnic tensions have risen in recent decades, especially since deadly violence in the regional capital, Urumqi, in July 2009. Uighurs now make up about 47 percent of the region’s civilian population of about 22.3 million, and ethnic Han about 38 percent, with the rest belonging to other ethnicities, according to government estimates.Responding to the growing ethnic violence across Xinjiang over the past year, the Chinese government has staged a succession of public verdicts and displays of security might in the region, apparently intended to deter fresh violence. Earlier this month, a court in Xinjiang sentenced 25 people to prison after convicting them of taking part in terrorist activities and harboring criminals.
