You may have eaten corn on the cob for the Fourth of July, but now is the time to get your fill. Joining the ranks at the corn stand and rummaging for the best ears (heavy and green, with fresh-looking husks and silk) is a summer ritual. The reward for waiting is blissfully sweet corn, the kind that induces a certain euphoria.One of my favorite ways to eat it: on the cob, absolutely, with good butter and salt. But try it, too, with lime juice, salt and hot chile powder, or slathered with fruity olive oil or basil pesto. Sauté off-the-cob kernels with chopped jalapeño and stir them into the batter for cornbread or muffins. Or add mushrooms to the corn in the pan, along with a dab of crème fraîche. Make a quick Indian-spiced corn soup to eat hot or cold with a dollop of yogurt.Corn and Jalapeño MuffinsThe flavor of these buttery, miniature muffins is amped up with sautéed corn kernels and jalapeño chiles. They are the perfect accompaniment to a pot of beans, but are tender and delicate enough to serve with an elegant chicken stew.Indian-Spiced Corn Soup With YogurtThe sweetness of summer corn marries nicely with a pleasant burst of Indian spices and tangy thick yogurt. Serve this vegetarian soup hot or chilled.More Recipes: Corn Dishes | Summer Produce
