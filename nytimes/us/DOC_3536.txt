COLUMBUS, Ohio â€” Ohio voters on Tuesday blocked a constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use, The Associated Press said.The decision was a setback for marijuana supporters who saw the state as a potential bellwether on legalization in the Midwest.This was more than a simple legalization issue, and even some longtime marijuana supporters opposed the amendment. The legalization amendment, known as Issue 3, called for giving wealthy investors who spent about $25 million to bankroll the referendum campaign exclusive rights to grow commercial marijuana initially. Some equated that provision to enshrining a monopoly in the State Constitution, and campaigned against the amendment on those grounds.Legalization supporters gained praise and scorn for touring the state with a marijuana mascot named Buddie, who was especially popular on college campuses. They produced commercials with celebrities including Oscar Robertson, the retired pro basketball player, and held news conferences with Montel Williams, a talk-show host who uses marijuana to help treat his multiple sclerosis.Also in Ohio, a battleground state with a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled Legislature, voters approved a plan to establish a new commission to oversee redistricting for legislative seats. The seven-member panel will include three people who won statewide elections, and four people appointed by the Democratic and Republican leaders in the Legislature.
