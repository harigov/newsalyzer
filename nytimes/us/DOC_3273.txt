SEOUL, South Korea — The former chief of a South Korean subsidiary of the British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser was sentenced on Friday to seven years in prison over disinfectants that have been blamed for scores of deaths in the country.The former chief, Shin Hyun-woo, who led Oxy Reckitt Benckiser from 1991 to 2005, was convicted of causing homicide through professional negligence and falsely advertising the disinfectant Oxy as safe. Three former and current researchers at the subsidiary were also sentenced to five to seven years on similar charges.Oh Yu-jin, the former chief of Cefu, a consumer goods manufacturer that marketed a disinfectant that was also found to be toxic, was sentenced to seven years. Two former executives at the South Korean retailers Lotte Mart and Homeplus each received four-year prison terms on charges of selling toxic disinfectants.At least 113 people, including infants, died from inhaling Oxy and other toxic disinfectants after sales began in 2001, according to government investigators, in the country’s worst consumer goods scandal. Hundreds of others had lung damage, they said. The Oxy product has been linked to the most cases.The disinfectants were used to sterilize humidifiers, commonly used in homes and offices in South Korea, especially during dry winters.“They had never done enough tests to ensure the safety of their disinfectants,” Choi Chang-young, a judge at the Seoul Central District Court, said in his ruling on Friday. “They even used false labels claiming that they were safe for humans, and even for babies.”Consumers began reporting deaths and lung damage related to humidifiers in 2011, prompting civic groups and eventually the health authorities to investigate.In May, Oxy Reckitt Benckiser apologized and acknowledged responsibility, offering to pay compensation.On Friday, it repeated its “heartfelt and sincere apology to all victims and their families.”The government, families of the victims and civic groups have been reviewing thousands of reported cases, trying to determine the true scale of the scandal.Some families say that more than 1,100 died because of the chemicals. They said in a statement on Friday that the sentences were too lenient and called for tougher penalties for corporate crimes.
