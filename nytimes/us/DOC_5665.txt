BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 18—Kneeling before a crowd of 10,000 a white‐robed Saudi prince was beheaded in Riyadh today for the assassination of his uncle, King Faisal, on March 25.The crowd reportedly watched silently as the executioner swung a sword with a golden hilt, but then thousands broke into chants of “God is great!” and “Justice is done!”Twenty‐seven‐year‐old Prince Faisal bin Musaed bin Abdelaziz had been convicted by a Koranic law court of having shot his uncle to death, the Saudi Government said in a broadcast announcing the beheading.The verdict of the religious court, which met in closed session, was approved by King Khaled, the late King's brother and successor, the announcement said.Crowd Hears VerdictReports from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said the verdict was announced to the crowd before the beheading. The crowd applauded.The sentence was carried out in a central square in front of the palace of the Governor of Riyadh, facing the great Central Mosque. According to the Saudi radio, the time was 4:30 P.M.A witness, reached by telephone, said the Prince was quiet and appeared calm as he was led to the execution spot.Afterward, his head was reported to have been displayed for a time on a wooden stake before being removed by ambulance together with the body for burial.The beheading was reported to have been witnessed by the Governor of Riyadh, Prince Salman, the younger brother of the slain King. He was said to have been the only member of the royal family among the spectators.Beheading Is TraditionalThe practice of public beheading is the traditional form of execution for a convicted murderer in Saudi Arabia, whose Islamic law prescribes the death penalty—“a soul for a soul,” in the words of the Prophet Mohammed—unless the defendant is found to be insane.Immediately after the assassination last March, the royal family had issued a statement saying the assailant was deranged.But since then a panel of medical experts ruled that he had been sane when he slipped past security guards and fired several shots from a revolver at King Faisal. The King was granting an audience at the time to a high Kuwaiti official.In the 16 weeks that Prince Faisal was held after the assassination, Saudi security authorities carried out an exhaustive investigation of the motives behind the killing and, according to Saudi sources, turned up no evidence of a conspiracy.The investigation extended to Prince Faisal's activities and personal acquaintances while he was studying in the United States, first at the University of Colorado and later at the University of California at Berkeley, from 1969 to 1973. He was once arested on charges of selling the drug LSD.After his return to Saudi Arabia, the Prince was an instructor at Riyadh University. He was reportedly regarded as unstable emotionally, and he was at one time under psychiatric treatment in Beirut.Annual Stipend RejectedPrince Faisal also aroused comment in the royal family when he rejected the annual stipend, said to have been about 812.000, to which he was entitled as a minor prince in a country where the royal family numbers at least 3,000 persons.He was reported to have been angered by the refusal of the royal authorities to issue him a passport to travel abroad early this year. The refusal was said to have been because of his arrest in the United States.There also was speculation that the Prince had shot his uncle to avenge the death of a brother, a religious zealot killed nine years ago by policemen breaking up a demonstration against attempts to modernize Saudi Arabia.‘For Good of Mankind’LOS ANGELES, June 18 (AP) —Christine Surma, who said she had lived with Prince Faisal during his stay in the United States, predicted today that he would eventually he recognized as the liberator of his country's people.“The way I feel about it is that if he did it—and I still want to emphasize the ‘if’—he did it for the good of mankind,” Miss Surma said in an interview, commenting on the assassination of King Faisal.She said she had met the Prince at the University of Colorado in September, 1968, when he was a student there. The last time she saw him, she said, was in July, 1974, here in Los Angeles, when he had completed his education and was about to return to Saudi Arabia,
