WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed on Monday to testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his connections to an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Mr. Sessions is expected on Tuesday to defend his interactions with both Russian officials and James B. Comey, who was fired by President Trump as F.B.I. director.The attorney general will face lingering questions about his meetings last year with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, which were revealed after he denied meeting with anyone from the Russian government during his confirmation hearing.Mr. Sessions said he recused himself from the Russia investigation because of his work for Mr. Trump during the campaign, though his announcement came a day after The Washington Post revealed his meetings with Mr. Kislyak. Senators are likely to question him about why he was then involved in the firing of Mr. Comey — a decision that Mr. Trump later said during an NBC News interview was related to the Russia investigation.Senators are also eager to talk to Mr. Sessions as Congress weighs whether Mr. Trump may have tried to obstruct justice by remarking to Mr. Comey that he hoped he would “let this go,” referring to the F.B.I. investigation into Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser.Mr. Sessions was present at the Feb. 14 meeting when Mr. Trump asked the attendees to leave so he could speak privately with Mr. Comey about the Flynn investigation.
