In a case that offers a glimpse into the lucrative but often hidden business of concert tickets, a small company has sued Live Nation Entertainment in federal court, accusing the multibillion-dollar concert giant of abusing its market power to control the sales of tickets through musicians’ websites and fan clubs.Songkick — a concert listings and ticketing company based in New York that has worked with artists like Adele, Paul McCartney, Ellie Goulding, Jackson Browne, Miranda Lambert and Ricky Martin — filed its suit on Tuesday in United States District Court in Los Angeles, accusing Live Nation and its subsidiary, Ticketmaster, of interfering in Songkick’s business in violation of federal antitrust law. According to the complaint, Live Nation and Ticketmaster “have attempted to destroy competition in the artist presale ticketing services market.”The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, also accuses Live Nation and Ticketmaster of threatening various unnamed “superstar” artists not to work with Songkick, and abusing its power as a concert promoter to influence how musicians sell their tickets. Those areas of Live Nation’s business are supposed to be maintained separately, under the terms of the 2010 merger agreement between Live Nation and Ticketmaster.The case highlights the value of the international touring market, where artists now often make the majority of their income. Live Nation, which declined to comment on the suit, is the world’s largest concert promoter, and in 2014 its Ticketmaster division sold $23 billion in tickets, according to company reports.Songkick’s case focuses on a little-known but highly valuable corner of the business: the sale of advance tickets through artists’ websites and fan clubs. While major ticketing companies like Ticketmaster often have exclusive deals with concert venues to sell tickets for all shows that take place there, musicians have historically been allowed to sell a small portion of the tickets — usually 8 percent, but sometimes more — directly to their followers through the artists’ fan clubs or websites, usually in “presales,” or limited offerings before tickets go on sale to the public.Songkick accuses Live Nation of applying behind-the-scenes pressure on musicians not to do business with Songkick and use Live Nation’s fan-club system instead.In its suit, Songkick said that it would reveal the artists’ names if a protective order is granted “to avoid providing defendants with a further opportunity to intimidate them.”
