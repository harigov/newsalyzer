BEIJING — Residents of an ethnically diverse prefecture in far northwest China that borders several nations have been asked to hand over their passports to the police by Friday or have the documents canceled, according to a notice circulating online and an interview with an officer on Thursday.The policy is an attempt by the authorities to combat a surge in ethnic violence in the region of Xinjiang by putting in place systemic restrictions on who is allowed to leave and enter China, particularly from the prefecture near the border. Tensions between ethnic Uighurs and the ruling ethnic Han, the dominant group in China, have been on the rise in the region in recent years.Chinese officials have also said they suspect jihadist ideology is taking hold among some Uighurs, who are mostly Sunni Muslims.“I actually think this notice is indicative of a significant shift in policy,” said Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia director of Amnesty International.The mandate on turning in passports was issued in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, a large and rugged area of northern Xinjiang that has a diverse ethnic mix among its three million people, including Kazakhs, Uighurs and Mongolians. Official statistics say 63 percent are ethnic minorities and the rest are Han.The prefecture has borders with Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia. Like the Uighurs, Kazakhs are also mostly Sunni Muslims, though Chinese officials have generally not accused them of taking part in terrorist activities.Uighurs in Xinjiang have had a hard time getting passports for many years, and the police in some cities and towns have been asking Uighurs to forfeit their passports. But the blanket withdrawal of passports across the prefecture of Ili, known as Yili to many Chinese, is a more formalized approach to what had been an ad hoc process by the police.A notice dated April 30 and circulating online this week from a police department in the city of Yining, known to Uighurs as Gulja, said the politics and law commission of Ili Prefecture, a Communist Party agency, had ordered all residents to hand in their passports by May 15. Yining is the site of occasional protests and riots by Uighurs against the local government and Han civilians, most notably in 1997. To end that eruption and ethnic clashes, security forces opened fire on Uighur civilians, people from Yining say.The Xinjiang government website says seven Han civilians were killed by rioters, and Uighur dissidents say scores of Uighurs were killed in the immediate crackdown. The 1997 protests and violence are still mentioned among many Uighurs today.The April 30 notice says that if residents do not hand in their passports by Friday, the local police department will notify the entry and exit office of the Public Security Bureau to have the passports voided.A police officer named Kahar whose phone number was listed on the notice confirmed the order when called on Thursday. He said the order applied to all residents, regardless of ethnicity, and covered the prefecture.When asked why the authorities had put in place the policy, he said he was just following orders and hung up.Zhao Xia, an employee at Yilimei Tourism Agency, a local company, explained that there were two kinds of passports in the area: tourism passports that are held by the police and are handed back to individuals only for the purpose of going on prearranged tours, and private passports that residents hold themselves.She said that the police stopped issuing private passports last November, but that residents in the area can still apply for tourism passports. Travel agencies running tours hold on to these passports during the trip and return them to the police after the tour ends.Mr. Bequelin said the restrictions were part of an array of counterinsurgency measures that have been rolled out by the authorities since Xi Jinping, the Chinese president and head of the Communist Party, began holding a series of meetings on Xinjiang policy since 2013.“Restricting the mobility of populations that the state views as being ‘infiltrated’ by subversive elements is a key aspect of counterinsurgency policies around the world, historically and today,” Mr. Bequelin said. “The goal is to strengthen control over the target population, prevent support from areas outside of the state sovereign borders, and facilitate state propaganda work by limiting the information sphere.”“These restrictions are deeply problematic,” he added, “reinforcing the sentiment of alienation of ethnic Uighurs, and fueling the feeling of being second-class citizens, suspect in eyes of the state simply because of their ethnicity.”
