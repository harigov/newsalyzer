Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which has come under fire for aggressively increasing the prices of its drugs, said late Wednesday that it had received two federal subpoenas related to its pricing, distribution and patient support practices.The subpoenas were issued by the United States attorney’s offices in Manhattan and Massachusetts.The company said that most of the material requested concerned the company’s patient assistance programs. They also included requests related to distribution of the company’s products, information provided to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the company’s pricing decisions.Patient assistance programs, such as when a company covers a patient’s co-payment, can help patients get a drug they might not otherwise be able to afford. But that means that Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurers have to pay for the drug.It is not unusual for drug companies to receive subpoenas, and in some cases investigations do not result in any charges or settlements.Valeant’s stock has been weak in the last month as attention has become focused on companies that have sharply raised prices of old drugs. Valeant attracted scrutiny from some members of Congress for acquiring two old heart drugs, Isuprel and Nitropress, in February and immediately increasing their prices by more than 500 percent and 200 percent.Last month, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, criticized the company for failing to respond substantively to a request for information she had made in August. In its announcement on Wednesday, Valeant said it had provided information on pricing to Senator McCaskill.Valeant also said that it was beginning to reach out to hospitals affected by the price increases.Valeant said it would cooperate with the inquiries.“All of us at Valeant firmly believe in maintaining strong regulatory and financial controls and believe we have operated our business in a fully compliant manner,” J. Michael Pearson, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement. He said the company remained “committed to assisting eligible patients who need our products.”Valeant has raised prices on many of its drugs, drawing the wrath of patients as well as hospitals. Some Wall Street reports show that Valeant is far more aggressive in raising prices than its peers.A report issued on Wednesday by Sector & Sovereign Research, a stock research firm, said that Valeant’s reliance on raising the prices of the drugs it sells in the United States was “extreme.”It said the average price of the company’s prescription drugs had grown 48 percent a year since 2007. The volume of drugs it sold declined by 18 percent a year, resulting in a net gain in United States prescription drug sales of 32 percent a year.In the past year, the report said, the situation was “even more dramatic,” with pricing gains of 93 percent offsetting volume declines of 39 percent to yield net sales growth of 55 percent.Some of the furor over drug prices was incited by Turing Pharmaceuticals, which acquired a 62-year-old drug for an infection and raised the price fiftyfold overnight.The New York State attorney general’s office has started an inquiry into Turing’s distribution practices. On Wednesday, the Twitter account of Martin Shkreli, Turing’s outspoken founder and chief executive, was suspended for reasons that are unclear.
