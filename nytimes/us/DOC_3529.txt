CHICAGO —  The mother of a transgender student said her daughter had suffered greatly since being banned from the girls’ locker room at a suburban Chicago high school.The comments, published on the website of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, were the first by the family since the federal Department of Education found this month that Township High School District 211 in Palatine had violated the girl’s rights under Title IX, a federal law that bans sex discrimination. The A.C.L.U. is representing the girl in a federal complaint against the district.The student’s name has not been released, and the mother’s name was not published with her roughly 1,000-word essay, titled “Our Child Is a Girl.”The mother described the family’s struggle with the daughter’s identity and the effect of not being able to use the girls’ bathroom or locker room or play on a girls’ sports team. She said her daughter had been “bullied on a daily basis.”“There were times she was inconsolable and all we could do was hold her and tell her that we loved her and would continue to advocate on her behalf,” the mother wrote.District officials have said they made reasonable accommodations for the student. They have said their policy is not in violation of the law and must balance the rights of the student with the privacy rights of the other 12,000-plus students.“The students in our schools are teenagers, not adults, and one’s gender is not the same as one’s anatomy,” the district said in a statement, according to The Chicago Tribune. “Our responsibility as school administrators is to protect the privacy rights of all our students.”The mother wrote that she and her husband once believed that “simple anatomy” separated a boy from a girl. But she said that after her child called herself a girl at age 4 and wanted to wear girls’ clothing, they questioned their understanding. She said they had sought help from medical professionals as well as their church, relatives, the school and friends.She wrote that the process had taught them acceptance.“Through this education process, we learned that gender extends beyond the sex a person is assigned at birth,” she wrote.
