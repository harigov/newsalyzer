Op-Docs is The New York Times editorial department’s award-winning forum for short, opinionated documentaries, produced with wide creative latitude and a range of artistic styles, covering current affairs, contemporary life and historical subjects.Op-Doc videos are produced by both renowned and emerging filmmakers who express their views in the first person, through their subjects, or more subtly through an artistic approach to a topic. Each Op-Doc is accompanied by a director’s statement.Since we started Op-Docs in 2011, we have introduced several series: Scenes (for very short work — snippets of street life, brief observations and interviews, clips from experimental works), Verbatim (which transforms legal transcripts into dramaticperformances), and Animated Life (which explores pivotal moments of scientific discovery). Interactive and multimedia special projects include “A Short History of the Highrise” and “Notes on Blindness.”Honors for Op-Docs include two News and Documentary Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award and the World Press Photo Multimedia Award for Interactive Documentary — as well as official selections at leading international film festivals (including Sundance, the New York Film Festival, Telluride, SXSW and Sheffield Doc/Fest).Join the conversation on Twitter: Follow the comissioning editor for opinion video, Kathleen Lingo (@kLL5), and @nytopinion for updates.
