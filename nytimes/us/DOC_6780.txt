The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news. Last week, Kendrick Lamar returned with his fourth studio album, “DAMN.” It was a turn to the interior after “To Pimp a Butterfly,” his 2015 masterpiece, which took stock of the state of black America.Mr. Lamar is, to many, a hip-hop savior and also a representative of values that have ceded their centrality in the genre. He is also, along with J. Cole and Chance the Rapper, part of a mainstream hip-hop counternarrative that has surged to the point of no longer being an alternative proposition, but instead, part of the center — one that recalls the hip-hop of the late 1980s into the mid-1990s, in terms of aesthetics, politics and technique.To discuss how these rappers are navigating an uncertain time, Mr. Caramanica was joined by James Braxton Peterson, an associate professor of English and the director of Africana studies at Lehigh University, the author of several books and the host of “The Remix” on WHYY.Email your questions, thoughts and ideas about what’s happening in pop music to popcast@nytimes.com.
