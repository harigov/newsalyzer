“Moses and the Brazen Serpent and the Transfiguration of Jesus,” the 1683 canvas that the Mexican artist Cristóbal de Villalpando painted for a chapel in Puebla Cathedral, has reputedly never been exhibited outside its place of origin. The work is striking for its juxtaposition of the Old and New Testaments. Atop is the transfiguration of Jesus’ corporeal body into light. The lower image portrays the biblical story in which Moses used the image of the brazen serpent to heal snake-poisoned Israelites. Starting Tuesday, July 25, the painting will go on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of “Cristóbal de Villalpando: Mexican Painter of the Baroque,” an exhibition that features 10 additional paintings, most of which have never been shown in the United States. Although perhaps best known for his ecclesiastical commissions, Villalpando was also an accomplished portrait artist famous for his 1695 painting of the main square of Mexico City, which depicts the capital’s main buildings, market and canal.
