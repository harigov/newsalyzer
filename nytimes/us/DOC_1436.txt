Many woolly mammoths from the North Sea had a superfluous rib attached to their seventh vertebra, a sign that they suffered from inbreeding and harsh conditions during pregnancy, researchers report.This may have contributed to their eventual extinction, say the scientists who looked at fossil samples that date to the late Pleistocene age, which ended about 12,000 years ago.At the time, mammoths were battling disease, famine and cold, which led to smaller populations. This led to inbreeding and unfit mammoths, said Frietson Galis, an evolutionary developmental biologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands.“It’s what you call an extinction vortex that becomes difficult to stop,” she said.Writing in the journal PeerJ, she and her colleagues report that the peculiar rib occurred in woolly mammoths 10 times as frequently as it does in modern elephants. Most mammals have seven neck vertebrae, Dr. Galis said, and extra ribs are not normal.Though the rib is harmless, it is generally a sign of some other sort of abnormality, she said. In humans and other mammals, cervical ribs are associated with stillbirths and congenital abnormalities.Woolly mammoths died out 12,000 to 10,000 years ago, when flowery plant covers disappeared from the tundra. Human hunting may also have contributed to their demise.But the cervical ribs are a clear indication that “they were already struggling before that,” Dr. Galis said.  SINDYA N. BHANOO
