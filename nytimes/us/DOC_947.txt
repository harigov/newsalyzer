Facebook isn’t just one giant meeting place. It is also full of gated communities — private groups that the company is emphasizing more these days.Only a small percentage of people on Facebook are seriously engaged in groups — 100 million or so of Facebook’s two billion users. That means that Facebook, always on the lookout for ways to get users more engaged on the network, has a big opportunity. It should come as no surprise, then, that the company is paying more attention to groups.To get a better sense of what these groups are like, Kevin Roose, a columnist for The New York Times, wiggled his way into more than 100 of them, from Pitbull Fans to Infidelity Support Group, entering a world that he calls “fascinating, enlightening and sometimes scary.” Kevin’s column, The Shift, offers sharp observations and a peek at where the giant social network could be headed.
