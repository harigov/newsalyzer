Q. For the past week or so, I keep getting a message on my Android tablet that my Google Now cards “failed to load.” What causes this and is there a way to fix it?A. The Google app’s onscreen cards create a personalized feed of information you care about, like traffic and weather, and the feed is updated regularly over your internet connection. However, the service has been hampered in the past by things like malfunctions on the Google side of things, incorrect Google Account settings or device problems.This month, many users began to complain on forums, blogs and social media about getting the “Failed to load cards” message in the Google app, as well as similar problems with the home screen in the Google Play app. The problem has not affected all users and a representative from Google confirms that the issue has been fixed. If your cards still will not load, you can try the known workarounds.On your Android device, open the Settings app, go to the Application Manager and select the Google app. Tap the Manage Space button and on the next screen, tap Clear Google Search Data; menu names may vary slightly based on the Android version.If your cards still fail to load, try turning your Google app feed off and on again in the settings. Deleting and reinstalling the Google app may also fix the issue, but you may have to redo some of your feed preferences.Changing your Google preferences can affect your cards. If you have recently changed your account settings (like turning off Web & App Activity), change the settings back to see if your feed is restored.
