Donald J. Trump’s suggestion that a Fox News journalist had questioned him forcefully at the Republican presidential debate because she was menstruating cost him a speaking slot Saturday night at an influential gathering of conservatives in Atlanta. It also raised new questions about how much longer Republican Party leaders would have to contend with Mr. Trump’s disruptive presence in the primary field.Continuing his complaints about Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators of the debate, in an interview on CNN Friday night, Mr. Trump said, “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” The remark prompted Erick Erickson, the leader of RedState, the conservative group, to disinvite him.“If your standard-bearer has to resort to that,” Mr. Erickson told hundreds of conservative activists in a packed Atlanta hotel ballroom on Saturday, “we need a new standard-bearer.”With Mr. Trump at center stage Thursday in Cleveland, Fox News shattered television viewership records for a primary debate: Nearly 24 million people watched. But any hopes that Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and television celebrity, would try to reinvent himself as a sober-minded statesman, or that he would collapse under scrutiny and tough questions, vaporized in the opening minutes when he refused to rule out running as an independent candidate for president. His remarks Friday only furthered the impression that he also had no intention of speaking more carefully. Mr. Trump denied on Saturday that he had been implying that Ms. Kelly was menstruating. “I think only a degenerate would think that I would have meant that,” he said in an interview, insisting that he had been referring to Ms. Kelly’s nose and ears.But as his latest eruption rippled through Republican circles, the conversation turned to whether the party, and his rival presidential contenders, should continue to accommodate his candidacy, quietly hoping that this would be the moment he burned out — or whether they should try to run him out on a rail.If party leaders saw danger in provoking a breakup — and no small advantage to be seized from the ratings bonanza Mr. Trump showed himself capable of delivering — there were signs that other influential Republicans would tolerate only so much of Mr. Trump’s behavior.“Come on,” Jeb Bush, who has campaigned as the adult among the party’s 17 presidential candidates, said in his remarks at the RedState gathering. “Give me a break. Do we want to win? Do we want to insult 53 percent of all voters? What Donald Trump said is wrong.”Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, who delivered perhaps the most assertive turn in Thursday’s debate among the candidates trailing in the polls, posted on Twitter: “Mr. Trump: There. Is. No. Excuse.” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went further, saying, “Enough already with Mr. Trump.”Yet in a sign of the lingering reluctance among some in the field to anger Mr. Trump’s supporters, other candidates, including former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, would not condemn Mr. Trump’s comments.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, in an interview to be broadcast Sunday, praised Ms. Kelly but stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to apologize. “I’ve made a decision here with Donald Trump, you know, if I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it,” he said. “That’s all I’ll do all day.”Mr. Rubio made the comments to Chuck Todd in a taped interview for NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Mr. Erickson — an author with his own track record of inflammatory remarks, sometimes about women — announced just before midnight Friday on the RedState website that he was disinviting Mr. Trump. He wrote that he admired Mr. Trump for his bluntness and for connecting with “so much of the anger in the Republican base.”“But there are even lines blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross,” he wrote. “Decency is one of those lines.”He added, “I just don’t want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal.”Mr. Trump’s campaign shot back at Mr. Erickson, calling him a “weak and pathetic leader” and his decision “another example of weakness through being politically correct.”But on Saturday, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize that he needed to create a diversion from the latest controversy and declared that he had fired Roger Stone, a Republican strategist and mischief-maker who had long been an adviser. But Mr. Stone said in an interview that he had resigned because the tenor of the campaign was distracting from Mr. Trump’s core message.In an interview with The New York Times on Friday afternoon, before he went on CNN, Mr. Trump said he was irritated by the debate moderators’ questions about a third-party candidacy, saying he wanted to run as a Republican, but he reiterated his threat to mount one if he is unhappy with his treatment by party leaders. An independent candidacy would be complicated and costly, he said, but “if you’re rich, it’s doable.”Some Republicans were trying to determine just who was rallying to Mr. Trump’s side, and how damaging it would be if his supporters left the party’s fold.“Trump isn’t and wasn’t going to get the conservative vote,” Joseph W. McQuaid, publisher of the Union Leader newspaper in New Hampshire, said in an email. “Conservative Republicans are worried about their party, but it’s still their party. Trump isn’t philosophically a conservative, and that will come out.”“Trump’s base is more the people who used to have season tickets to the Roman Colosseum,” Mr. McQuaid wrote. “Not sure that they vote in great numbers, but they like blood sport.”But others on the right said the disaffected voters rallying to Mr. Trump represented a constituency that Republicans would be foolish to ignore.“People have to get their minds wrapped around the fact that the seething fury at the leadership of the Republican Party is real, and it’s going to bubble over somehow with somebody, and right now it’s with Trump,” said the conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham, noting that there were “a lot of ticked-off people out there who are willing to throw both parties into the fire.”Mr. Erickson himself got a taste of Mr. Trump’s die-hard loyalists, recounting in his speech at the conference Saturday that he had received a vitriolic response to his decision to bar Mr. Trump.“We will not gain the White House,” said Mr. Erickson about the inflammatory messages he had received, “if we’re screaming at people, calling them whores and queer and the N-word.”Even before Friday night, prominent Republican women said they were worried about how female voters would respond to Mr. Trump’s prominence on the debate stage, where he defended imprecations like “fat pigs” and “bimbo” to describe women — and his rivals did not chide him.But Mr. Trump’s comment Friday night about Ms. Kelly caused a new bout of consternation among senior Republican leaders, who saw it as the latest distraction from the business of choosing a presidential candidate who can return the White House to the party in 2016.“We need to nominate somebody who can win, somebody who is substantive and somebody who knows how to govern,” said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. “But we can’t have that debate in the full jacket as long as we’re sidetracked off on this Trump exercise. It does undermine our ability to have a substantive debate. All the substantive arguments are being muted by his persona.”Still, Mr. Gregg said that while RedState was wise to bar him from its event, the party would only “make him an even larger figure” by trying to keep him out of future debates. “He’d love that,” Mr. Gregg said. “He loves when institutional forces take him on. That’s part of his shtick.”He added: “The campaign is serious, but his campaign isn’t. It’s entertainment. What’s the line of decency in the entertainment world? It’s pretty far out there.”Some in the party have mused privately about using Mr. Trump’s refusal to rule out an independent bid as grounds to bar him from future debates, but there is deep concern that such a heavy-handed effort would only prod him into pursuing such a run.It also appeared unlikely that any network could be persuaded to exclude him. As Mr. Trump crowed Friday in a telephone interview, “I’m a ratings machine.”In Atlanta, there was resignation to the likelihood that Mr. Trump would continue to draw support from voters looking to rage against the political establishment. But some of the grass-roots activists in attendance described him as a jester, not a threat.David Pettigrew, a retiree from Milledgeville, Ga., said he knew many conservatives who regretted voting for Ross Perot in 1992 out of frustration with President George Bush. (Mr. Perot’s third-party candidacy is widely believed to have helped tilt the election to Bill Clinton.) But he said he doubted Mr. Trump could win over enough disgruntled Republicans to undermine the party’s nominee.“Hell, if he wants to run as a third party, have at it,” Mr. Pettigrew said.Mr. Trump, for his part, fired off a defiant salute to the RedState crowd on Twitter Saturday morning: “I miss you all, and thanks for all of your support. Political correctness is killing our country.”He added in a word what he thought of his critics: “weakness.”
