Gay rights advocates in North Carolina filed a federal lawsuit on Monday, challenging a new state law that overturns local protections for gay and transgender people, and bars transgender people from using public bathrooms that do not match the sexes stated on their birth certificates.The plaintiffs, a coalition of individuals and civil liberties groups, charged that the bill approved on Wednesday by the Republican majorities in the General Assembly, and signed by Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, violated the Constitution and federal anti-discrimination laws.“Let’s be clear: The legislature and Governor McCrory have done nothing less than encourage discrimination,” said Chris Brook, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina.Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality North Carolina, a gay rights group, said, “Our national partners have told us that this is the most sweeping and the most dangerous anti-L.G.B.T. bill they’ve seen at least this session, and in quite a while.”Several large companies and business groups have protested the law, and opponents have predicted an economic backlash against the state.The state General Assembly called a special session to take up the bill, at a cost of $42,000, held no hearings, allowed little debate and passed the measure hours after it was introduced. Republicans supported it unanimously, while many Democrats walked out in protest. Mr. McCrory, who is running for re-election this year, quickly signed it.Republicans said the bill was prompted in part by a city ordinance passed in Charlotte last month allowing people to use public restrooms that correspond to the sexes they identify with, not necessarily their sex at birth.Some conservatives complained that the ordinance would endanger women and girls by allowing people who are anatomically male to use their restrooms, an argument that has been used elsewhere. Transgender advocates dismiss that as nonsense, saying that transgender people have been using their chosen bathrooms for years without incident.The new state law overturns any such local protections, saying that people may use only public locker rooms or restrooms that correspond to the sexes on their birth certificates. North Carolina law allows a transgender person to change the sex indicated on a birth certificate, but only after gender reassignment surgery, which most transgender people do not undergo.But the law also goes far beyond the question of bathrooms, superseding any ordinance that offers any kind of anti-discrimination protection for gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people. It also prohibits cities from setting local minimum wages higher than the statewide minimum of $7.25 an hour.
