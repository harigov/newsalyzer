It’s not every day you see a film in Marathi. But Shrihari Sathe’s “1000 Rupee Note,” true to its origins in the Maharashtra State of India, is told in a dialect of that language.In this light tale, Budhi (Usha Naik), a widow in a rural hamlet, has lost her son, a farmer, to suicide because he could not repay a moneylender, a very real problem in the region in recent years.She cherishes each match and drop of oil in her one-room hovel, yet she always shares, giving part of her meager meal of bread to a dog and even a few crumbs to a colony of red ants. A year after her son’s death, she smiles as she passes through the village buying necessities. To support herself, she cleans the home of a wealthy family.Her best friend is the young man next door, Sudama (Sandeep Pathak), a goatherd who shares tea with her. He is the one Budhi chooses to accompany her on a shopping expedition to a nearby town after she comes by a few 1,000-rupee notes at a political rally.And that is where the singularly third world misadventures begin, for what merchant can break such a large bill, especially at the beginning of the business day? And what unsavory police official can resist someone from the countryside carrying a handful of bills?A parable about the contagious nature of corruption and the curse of dirty money, “1000 Rupee Note” asks, How valuable is a windfall to people who live their lives largely without money?Its conclusion, harrowing, humorous and arguably unfortunate, only reinforces the idea that the unsophisticated country people are better off as they were.
