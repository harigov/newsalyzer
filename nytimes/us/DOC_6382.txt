After the global financial crisis, Europe built a system designed to contain the collateral damage from failing banks. That new system appeared to pass its first test on Wednesday, as authorities efficiently dispatched a troubled Spanish lender.The relative lack of drama after the failure of Banco Popular, Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, highlighted the large strides made by the eurozone compared with a few years ago, when the problems of even small lenders had the potential to rock financial markets and raise existential questions about European unity.Bank stocks rose in Europe after authorities in Frankfurt and Brussels declared that Banco Popular was essentially a lost cause and sold it to Banco Santander, Spain’s largest bank. The swift action by European Central Bank and European Union officials defied critics who said a system for winding down sick banks, put into place at the end of 2014, was too unwieldy to deal with a fast-moving crisis.“It’s very positive for establishing the new banking policy framework,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “It will demonstrate to a number of people that the framework is working better than many doubters expected.”The rescue is the first in which the European Central Bank has determined that a eurozone lender has failed or is about to fail. The central bank assumed authority over eurozone banks in 2014 as part of changes intended to prevent banking crises like that of 2008.But the failure of Banco Popular, felled by its exposure to toxic mortgages left over from a housing boom, was nevertheless a reminder that, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, the eurozone’s banking system remains vulnerable.Many banks in Italy, Germany and elsewhere in the 19-country euro area suffer from piles of bad loans, thin capital cushions and meager profits. The woes of banks continue to weigh on economic growth in the bloc.The decision by the European Central Bank to classify Banco Popular as a failed or nearly failed bank could also raise questions about whether the central bank is applying new regulations consistently. The Spanish bank’s takeover comes less than a week after the European Commission gave preliminary approval to plans for a government rescue of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a troubled Italian bank.For Monte dei Paschi to qualify for government aid, the European Central Bank must determine that it is solvent. But by some measures, the Italian lender is in worse shape than Banco Popular. Monte dei Paschi fared significantly worse than the Spanish lender in assessments of bank health last year. The central bank could be accused of playing favorites if it clears the way for Monte dei Paschi to receive a taxpayer rescue.The path of the two banks also serves to illustrate the diverging economic fates of Spain and Italy.Spain, one of the countries hardest hit by the eurozone debt crisis in 2010, has since cleaned up many of its domestic banks — though clearly not Banco Popular — and taken politically unpopular steps to improve the functioning of the economy, like making it easier for companies to fire unwanted workers. Spanish unemployment is dropping from catastrophic levels and growth is among the fastest in the eurozone.By contrast, Italy is only beginning to institute such reforms, the economy is barely growing, and many Italian banks remain fragile. The government in Rome has not been willing to risk letting a big bank fail and perhaps creating a broad market panic.Italian authorities also feared the political ramifications if Monte dei Paschi collapsed. Without government aid, the bank would be forced to impose losses on thousands of middle-class savers who bought the bank’s bonds. There is fear the public backlash would benefit populist parties and add to political turmoil in the country.In Spain, the government signaled it did not want taxpayers to rescue Banco Popular, even though investors would bear some of the pain.If, as is likely, the European Central Bank allows the rescue of Monte dei Paschi to proceed, it can argue the situation is different than in Spain. By requesting approval to provide capital to Monte dei Paschi, the government triggered different procedures than apply to Banco Popular.Still, Mr. Véron of Bruegel predicted that Banco Popular’s collapse would prompt lawsuits by people who own its bonds and are losing their money.The Spanish bank’s problems stem from the large mortgage portfolio it built up during the country’s housing boom. When the European banking crisis struck in 2012, several lenders had to take emergency action, and Banco Popular opted to raise capital multiple times over the next four years.But its mortgage problems mounted, and it reported an annual loss of €3.5 billion in 2016. In February, it hired a new chairman, Emilio Saracho, to help lead a turnaround.Mr. Saracho set about selling nonstrategic assets and began looking for new ways to raise financing, before announcing in April that his bank might instead seek a merger. He eventually hired outside bankers to organize an auction, but Banco Popular said last week that it had failed to receive any formal offers.Shares of Banco Popular had dropped by more than half in the past week over concerns that the bank would need additional capital as it struggled under the weight of billions of euros in bad real estate loans.Officials at the European Central Bank, which is responsible for supervising eurozone banks, had been closely monitoring Banco Popular. By Tuesday, as it became clear that the bank could no longer borrow money from other banks and was running out of cash, the European Central Bank had determined that the lender was “failing or likely to fail.”“The significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due,” the central bank said.Responsibility for winding down Banco Popular then passed to the Single Resolution Board in Brussels, which sold the bank to Santander. The multilayered system had been criticized as too cumbersome, but functioned in this case.The combined business of Banco Popular and Santander will be led by the current management team of Santander Spain with Rami Aboukhair as chief executive, Santander said.“We welcome Banco Popular’s customers as part of the Santander Group and will work hard to continue serving them at the highest standards through the transition and beyond,” Ana Botín, the executive chairwoman of Santander, said in a news release.Still, while the acquisition averts a banking crisis, it also increases Santander’s dominance of the Spanish banking market and reduces competition, which could eventually be bad for customers.The takeover of Banco Popular comes five years after the near-collapse of a giant Spanish mortgage lender, Bankia. That forced the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to negotiate a huge European banking bailout. In the end, Spain needed €41 billion of bailout money.
