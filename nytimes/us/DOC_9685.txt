LONDON — Britain voted in June to leave the European Union. But the process truly began on March 29, when the government invoked a treaty provision — Article 50 — that set out the basics of a withdrawal.Article 50 is the part of the European Union treaty that lays down the procedure for a member to leave the 28-nation bloc. It was drafted under the Treaty of Lisbon, which was meant to streamline the bloc’s decision-making.No. In fact, the treaty’s architects never expected it to be used. Although no country has quit before, Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, left the European Union’s forerunner entity in the 1980s.A member country that wants to leave can invoke Article 50. Who, exactly, had the right to do so in Britain was the issue of a legal challenge. Prime Minister Theresa May argued that she could do it without Parliament, under powers known as the royal prerogative. A court ruled against her, but Parliament allowed her to invoke Article 50 without any restrictions on her negotiating powers.Under Article 50, negotiations on withdrawal must be completed within two years. That deadline can be extended, but only with the agreement of all European Union member states.If there is no agreement to extend the negotiating period, and no deal, then Britain would find itself outside the bloc and without any preferential status with the European Union.The British government says no, and that once it is invoked, Britain will have to leave the union. But several legal experts disagree, including one of the authors of the provision. As yet, this has not been tested.
