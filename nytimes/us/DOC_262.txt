Quentin Tarantino, known for his graphic and violent films, is reportedly tackling a real-life crime for his next project: a film about the Manson family murders.The Hollywood Reporter said on Tuesday that the project is still in its early stages. Mr. Tarantino is almost finished writing the script, according to the report, and actors including Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence have been approached.Charles Manson and his disciples have inspired a number of recent films and TV series, although Mr. Tarantino’s would be the highest profile yet.Mr. Manson orchestrated killings in Southern California in 1969, with a group of men and women he called “the Family.” One of their victims was the actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of the director Roman Polanski, who will reportedly be a focus of Mr. Tarantino’s film.The dark material is nothing new for Mr. Tarantino, a writer and director of “Inglourious Basterds” and “Django Unchained,” among others. His most recent film was “The Hateful Eight” (2015).Plans call for shooting to begin next year, The Hollywood Reporter said.A representative for William Morris Endeavor, an agency reportedly involved in marketing the film to studios, did not immediately respond to request for comment.
