Speculate no more. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the co-hosts of “Morning Joe” on MSNBC whose off-air relationship had been the source of rumors, are now engaged.An MSNBC spokeswoman confirmed the engagement. In an interview in Vanity Fair, the couple described how their relationship evolved.“Over the past year and a half, I realized I had to face these feelings and that it was time to stop putting them in a box,” Ms. Brzezinski told the magazine. “It was not an easy process and it was not an easy set of decisions for either of us. It was something I couldn’t deny anymore.”Mr. Scarborough, who has been married twice before, told Vanity Fair he thought he would “never, ever do this again in a million years.”“Then it occurred to me that with us working together and being live on the air every day for three hours that we were forced, no matter what disagreements we had, what misunderstandings we had, to work through it and get right with each other by 5:59 a.m.,” he said.They have hosted the morning show together since 2007, but they spent most of that time in other relationships. Mr. Scarborough divorced his wife in 2013, and Ms. Brzezinski split with her husband in December 2015.The couple had never publicly discussed their romantic relationship. The closest they came was in April, when Mr. Scarborough told The Hollywood Reporter that “we have a crackling on-air chemistry, and a crackling off-air chemistry, too.”According to Vanity Fair, President Trump offered to host the wedding at the White House or at Mar-a-Lago, and even to officiate the wedding himself.“The mental picture is just fascinating, but the reality is just … no. No, no, no, no, no,” Ms. Brzezinski said.
