A court of appeals in Paris, defending equal treatment under the law, ruled last Wednesday that ethnic profiling by the police is discriminatory. The court found that five men who complained they’d been repeatedly stopped by the police and subjected to humiliating identity checks solely because of their skin color and ethnic appearance had indeed been done a grave injustice.In 2013, a Paris tribunal found in favor of the government, saying the plaintiffs had failed to prove discrimination. The plaintiffs — supported by the Open Society Justice Initiative, the Union of French Lawyers and the French Stop Racial Profiling group — appealed that decision, which culminated in last week’s victory.Unfortunately, the ruling does not go far enough. The Paris appeals court rejected the complaints of eight other of the original 13 plaintiffs, arguing that the stopping of individuals by the police solely on the basis of their ethnic appearance could be legitimate in “dangerous” areas. This is a big mistake.Ethnic profiling by the police contributes to anger and frustration among residents with North African and sub-Saharan African backgrounds in France’s suburbs. A 2009 study indicated that individuals identified as “black” and “North African” were six to eight times more likely to be stopped by the police than whites.After the ruling in Paris, the plaintiffs’ lawyers vowed to file similar complaints in other cities. Courts in other jurisdictions should reject the argument — essentially made by the Paris court — that profiling is acceptable in neighborhoods where many minorities live.In the meantime, the French government can take steps to reduce ethnic profiling, like requiring that the police issue a written receipt indicating the reason for a stop so that individuals can challenge the legality of police actions they believe to be discriminatory. President François Hollande pledged during his 2012 campaign to end ethnic profiling by the police. He has done too little to fulfill that promise.
