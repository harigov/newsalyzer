As “Vinyl” wraps up its first season on HBO, this costly period drama about the music industry has already hit some worrisome bumps: on Friday it was announced that Terence Winter, the show runner and a co-creator of the series, was leaving and would be replaced by new producers. In a statement HBO said it had decided it was “an appropriate time to make a change in the creative direction of the show.”“Vinyl,” whose creators also include Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, arrived with considerable expectations when it had its premiere in February with a two-hour episode directed by Mr. Scorsese. But since then, the series, which stars Bobby Cannavale as a fictional record executive in 1970s New York, has struggled to find a wider audience or much critical acclaim. (Its most recent episode, which aired last Sunday, drew fewer than 600,000 viewers for its debut broadcast.)Mr. Winter was previously the show runner of HBO’s gangster drama “Boardwalk Empire” and had been a producer on “The Sopranos,” as well as the screenwriter of Mr. Scorsese’s film “The Wolf of Wall Street.” HBO said in its statement that Scott Z. Burns, a writer of films like “The Bourne Ultimatum,” “The Informant” and “Contagion,” will be the new show runner of “Vinyl,” and that Max Borenstein (“Godzilla”) will join him as an executive producer. Together, HBO said, they will be “the new team helming the show.”A press representative for Mr. Winter declined to comment on Friday.
