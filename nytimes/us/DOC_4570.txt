No animals were harmed in the making of “Phelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White,” which airs Sunday, July 23, on Discovery as part of Shark Week. Neither were any humans. The people at Discovery were not about to put the American swimmer Michael Phelps in proximity to a predator that might take a bite out of the body that propelled him to 23 Olympic gold medals. But they did want to see how his performance would compare with that of a great white in a 100-meter race — if Mr. Phelps were, say, transported to shark-friendly, 55-degree waters off South Africa and outfitted with a monofin. (He was also surrounded by 15 safety divers.) Mr. Phelps has estimated his fastest racing speed at 5 or 6 miles per hour; with the monofin, he topped out at close to 12. (For a great white, it’s 25.) “It’s challenging to handicap a race like that, and I think we did our best to try to make it as close as we could,” Mr. Phelps said in an Entertainment Weekly interview, “and try to have other people to have an understanding just how powerful and how fast these animals are.”
