In 1997, Al Gore, then the vice president of the United States, helped forge the first climate change treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, promising the rest of the world that the United States would lead the fight against global warming. That promise was broken when President George W. Bush later announced that the United States would abandon the treaty.In 2015, President Barack Obama made the same promise when he helped forge the Paris climate accord â€” a promise that was broken when President Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the United States from the deal.In a TimesTalks conversation in New York on Tuesday, I spoke with Mr. Gore about what went through his mind when Mr. Trump made his Paris announcement. Watch to find out how the Nobel Prize-winning climate change activist sees the landscape of policy unfolding in the 21st century, as the effects of climate change become more clear.
