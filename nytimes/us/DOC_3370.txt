Schoolgirls (and boys) gone bad were at the heart of the pop star Rihanna’s third Fenty x Puma collection, shown in Paris on Monday night.A “Fenty University” spectacle was held under the soaring ceilings, multileveled bookshelves and gilded rails of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, a.k.a. the French National Library, where models stomped down long study tables in a raunchy rewrite of traditional American collegiate style.Plaid uniform skirts were teamed with open puffer coats, for example, or with matching bustiers over hooded sweatshirts. And cheerleader outfits featured practice sweaters cropped high enough to warrant detention (which, according to the themed invitations, was the reason the guests were being summoned).A starry front row included the rappers The Dream and Future, the singers Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas, and the actress Cara Delevingne, with newly bobbed, peroxide-blond hair. Most leapt to their feet when Rihanna, Our Lady of Perpetual Detention, came out from behind a row of lockers to take a triumphant finale bow.
