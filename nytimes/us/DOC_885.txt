LONDON — A British regulator on Wednesday signed off on the consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser’s planned acquisition of the K-Y brand of personal lubricants, but said it would require the company to license the brand to a competitor in Britain for a period of eight years.Reckitt agreed in March 2014 to acquire the K-Y brand from Johnson & Johnson for an undisclosed amount. Reckitt also owns the Durex brand of condoms and lubricants.In May, the Competition and Markets Authority of Britain said it was concerned that the acquisition of the K-Y brand could lead to higher prices. K-Y and Durex account for nearly three-quarters of the market for personal lubricants sold in supermarkets and drugstore chains in Britain, where a vast majority of consumers buy the products, the regulator said.By licensing the K-Y brand, a competitor to Reckitt Benckiser would then have an existing platform from which to develop a new brand to compete with Durex in Britain, Phil Evans, the chairman of the authority’s inquiry, said in a news release.The eight-year license would make it easier for the new brand to gain access to supermarkets and national pharmacy chains — and a larger customer basis — in order to protect competition, he said.In a summary of its final report, the Competition and Markets Authority said there was little evidence that specialty shops and online outlets, which offer competing products, “could act as a brake on any price rises in supermarkets and national pharmacy chains.”“Historically smaller-scale suppliers have had little success getting access to the shelves in these larger shops,” the regulator said.The K-Y brand began as a prescription medical product in 1917 and has been sold over the counter since 1980. The brand is available in more than 50 countries and had sales of over $100 million in 2013.In addition to the Durex brand, Reckitt manufactures a variety of consumer products, including Air Wick air fresheners, Lysol cleaning sprays and French’s mustard.
