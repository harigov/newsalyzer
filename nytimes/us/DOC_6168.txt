The recycling of narratives is hardly unique to horror movies, but it does sometimes seem that what should be the most fertile of genres — there are, after all, virtually unlimited ways in which monstrousness can be unleashed in the world — is disproportionally afflicted.So by this point, a horror heroine who finds a strange box — even one that offers to grant wishes — shouldn’t require a degree in Greek mythology to steer well clear. Not Clare (Joey King), though, the wistful teenager in “Wish Upon” who’s traumatized by what she believes was her mother’s suicide many years earlier. Embarrassed by her Dumpster-diving father (Ryan Phillippe) and hounded by the resident high school meanie, Clare wishes only to be rich, popular and adored by her hunky crush. Maybe this funny-looking music box covered in Chinese characters can help?As directed by John R. Leonetti, “Wish Upon” would rather make you jump than gag. The splatter is deployed cautiously and sometimes wittily, the story moving briskly from wishes granted to costs exacted with the help of familiar faces (including a warm Sherilyn Fenn as Clare’s surrogate mother) and a sympathetic lead. Pressing gently on the bruise of a broken home to explain Clare’s addiction to the evil receptacle (in a move that recalls “The Possession” a few years back), Barbara Marshall’s zippy script cuts corners without severing its bond to Clare’s emotions. Unlike Pandora, Ms. Marshall prefers to release a little bit of hope.
