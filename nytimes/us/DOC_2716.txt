The political arm of Planned Parenthood is beginning a $30 million effort to encourage voters to turn out for the presidential contest and for Senate races in targeted states, a giant investment that is aimed at benefiting the Democrats in 2016.The director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Deirdre Schifeling, called the work “unprecedented” for her group. The goal is to target millennial voters, and the organization has knocked on a million doors in Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those are crucial battlegrounds in the presidential campaign, but also states with competitive Senate races, Ms. Schifeling said.There are 800 paid canvassers in the states and 3,500 volunteers, she said. “The heart and soul of our program is a door-to-door, face-to-face canvass,” she added.Their messaging includes informing voters of Donald J. Trump’s comments on abortion. Ms. Schifeling also said a fair amount of their efforts had been spent on educating voters about Hillary Clinton’s time as a New York senator.
