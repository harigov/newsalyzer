HONG KONG — Officials in Taiwan raised concerns on Friday that dozens of fraud suspects from Taiwan were at risk of being sent from Malaysia to China, much as Kenya deported a similar group of suspects this week.Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said Friday evening that 20 of the suspects had been put on a flight to Taiwan but that the fate of an additional 32 suspects remained unclear.China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and frequently seeks to limit its recognition overseas. The deportations have raised fears in Taiwan that China is using its international clout to put pressure on the self-ruled island.Taiwan’s government is scrambling to deal with the deportations in the midst of a political transition. Next month, President Ma Ying-jeou, who pursued closer ties with China during his eight years in office, will step down. His successor, Tsai Ing-wen, advocates more caution and public deliberation in cross-strait ties.A group of officials from Taiwan will travel to China next week to discuss the deportations, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said Friday.China’s Ministry of Public Security says the  Internet telephone fraud in China has grown drastically, aided by the easy availability of people’s telephone numbers and other private data. And criminals from Taiwan — able to speak Mandarin Chinese, but living beyond China’s harsh criminal justice system — have often been the perpetrators, according to Chinese news reports.“Telecommunications fraud syndicates led by Taiwanese crime suspects have set up operations in Southeast Asia, Africa and Oceania,” said Xinhua, China’s main state news agency. In recent years, complaints to the Chinese police about such fraud have grown from 20 percent to 30 percent annually, and over half of the losses in such cases went to gangs led by people from Taiwan, said Xinhua, citing official Chinese estimates.Last year, one such gang swindled a payment manager in a local government office in southwest China and made off with 117 million renminbi, or about $18 million, the report said.In recent months, the Chinese police have also worked with the Malaysian authorities to track and break up a series of telephone fraud gangs operating from Malaysia that targeted mainland Chinese residents, according to Chinese newspaper reports.Like the suspected fraud calls from Kenya, these were said to have been perpetrated by people from Taiwan who recruited mainland Chinese for support staff, operating out of rented townhouses where they worked banks of phones to call China. But it was not clear whether the Taiwanese suspects facing deportation to mainland China were arrested over those cases or similar ones.In January, police officers from China traveled to Malaysia and helped investigators break up eight fraud operations based in Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang and other places, a local Chinese government news site said at the time. That operation caught 44 suspects, half from mainland China and half from Taiwan, the report said.Since 2011, the police in China and Taiwan have detained about 7,700 people suspected of participating in telephone fraud operations from Southeast Asia and other parts of the world, Xinhua said on Thursday. More than 4,600 of the suspects were from Taiwan, it said.But Xinhua suggested that Beijing had decided to bring the Taiwanese suspects in such cases to China for investigation and likely prosecution because the Chinese authorities believed that the courts in Taiwan were not securing enough convictions.“Because the penalties for telecommunications fraud are quite light in Taiwanese law, and there are major disparities with the standards of evidence that apply in the mainland, many crime suspects cannot be convicted or receive light sentences for serious crimes,” Xinhua said. Taiwan’s conviction rate in these cases was less than 10 percent, it said.Officials from Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice say prosecutions for cross-border telecommunications fraud can be difficult because of problems obtaining sufficient evidence. Those convicted of telecommunications fraud face up to seven years in prison in Taiwan.
