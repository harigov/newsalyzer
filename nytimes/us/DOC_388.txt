Q. If long-ago victims of the bubonic plague are dug up, could the germs infect someone?A. The body of a person who died from plague would not transmit the disease to another person unless that person had been in contact with lymph nodes, respiratory tissues or bodily secretions soon after the death or had encountered a body that was frozen and then thawed, said Dr. Roy M. Gulick, chief of infectious disease at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.Neither sequence of events seems likely, Dr. Gulick said, adding that fleas from plague-infected rodents in the area would be much more suspect.Bubonic plague, one form of a chiefly flea-spread disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is only rarely spread from person to person among the living, and any disease-causing organisms in an infected person who dies usually decompose quickly, Dr. Gulick said.Bubonic plague is not directly transmitted from one human to another unless there is direct contact with lymph node tissue or secretions, he said. However, the pneumonic and septicemic forms of the plague can be transmitted through infected droplets in the air.“In the Middle Ages,” Dr. Gulick said, “corpses of people who died of plague were used as biological weapons by catapulting them into walled cities.” The disease did spread to townspeople (and catapulters), he said, but it is not clear whether it was spread by bodily secretions or infected fleas.
