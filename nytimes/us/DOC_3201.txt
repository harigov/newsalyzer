LONDON — The London Stock Exchange Group and the Deutsche Börse said on Monday that they would lower the acceptance threshold required from shareholders in the German exchange operator for their merger to proceed.The exchanges also said they would extend by two weeks the period for investors in the German exchange to accept the offer to exchange their Deutsche Börse stock for shares in a new holding company for the combined entity. The offer period will now expire on July 26. It was originally set to expire on Tuesday.Last week, shareholders in the London exchange overwhelmingly approved the all-stock deal, which the stock exchange operators hope will create a European champion in the industry.But a vote by Britons to leave the European Union has raised questions about whether the merger could be completed under its current terms, and in particular whether the combined entity’s holding company should be based in Britain, as planned.Some German investors have called for the companies to re-evaluate their plans and to move the holding company’s base elsewhere in the European Union. The head of BaFin, the German financial regulator, has also questioned whether the combined business could be based in the European Union given the outcome of the referendum.The merger agreement had originally called for at least 75 percent of Deutsche Börse’s outstanding shares to be tendered in the offer, but the companies agreed to lower the threshold to 60 percent on Monday.By lowering the threshold, they have made it easier for index funds to participate in the offering, the companies said.Index funds represent up to 15 percent of Deutsche Börse’s shares and, because of a technical issue, can be tendered only once the minimum acceptance threshold is reached.“This change in procedure is a purely technical one,” Gregor Pottmeyer, Deutsche Börse chief financial officer, said in a news release. “We are confident that we will reach the 75 percent threshold in the course of the full tender process.”The exchange operators agreed to an all-stock merger in March, but are now having to deal with the fallout of the referendum, which could greatly change Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe.The exchange operators had previously said that an exit by Britain would not change the deal, but that it could “well affect the volume or nature” of business carried out by the combined company.Their boards have since formed a referendum committee to make recommendations to the board of the combined group “in order to meet all regulatory requirements to secure closing of the transaction and achieve its commercial objectives.”The committee’s work may take “many months,” the companies have said.
