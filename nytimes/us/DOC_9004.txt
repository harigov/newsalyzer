Cardoons are clearly related to artichokes, but in no way do they rank as highly, and that’s just the way it is.I was strolling in a garden the other day and, seeing what I thought were cardoons (because I’m only slightly obsessed with them), asked the gardener, “Oh, are those cardoons?” Her reply: “Oh, God no. Those are artichokes. I’d never grow cardoons.”Found in farmers’ markets and grocery stores with a wide array of produce, cardoons may not be anyone’s favorite vegetable. But when you consider all the effort that goes into cooking ramps (which, really, no one would bother with if they did not come so early), I think a minor investment in cardoon cooking is worth the trouble. Because with the right technique, they’re pretty great.They don’t need much prep: Strip the leaves if there are any, trim brown spots and string as you would celery. Cut the whole stalk lengthwise into two or three strips, then make crosswise lengths of a couple of inches. Parboiling until tender (10 minutes or so) is definitely worthwhile because they can be bitter. Drain and rinse, and that bitterness is all but gone.Then cook however you like; this recipe will probably spawn many ideas for you.
