An unemployed loner with an enthusiasm for guns and young boys burst into a primary school in Dunblane, Scotland, Wednesday, killing 16 children, all under  age 7, their teacher and wounding 12 other children before killing himself.As Dunblane, a tiny cathedral town in central Scotland, struggled to recover  from the worst mass murder in recent British memory, it emerged that the gunman, 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton, had been granted gun permits for all four guns used in the shooting, including two semi-automatic pistols.Local politicians said they had repeatedly tried to have Mr. Hamilton, who was stripped of his position as a Boy Scout leader in 1974, removed from the boys' clubs he ran. But the police said that they had been unable to charge him  with any criminal acts and that he had met Britain's tight legal requirements for gun ownership.Messages of sympathy poured in from all over the world, and Queen Elizabeth said that her heart went out to the victims' families. "May their courage remain undimmed," she said.   SARAH LYALL
