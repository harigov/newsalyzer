When the national anthem played before the start of the preseason game with the Green Bay Packers on Friday night, Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, took a stand by not standing.Explaining the gesture, Kaepernick said that he had decided to remain seated as a statement against racial oppression.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he told NFL Media in an interview published on Saturday.“To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,” he said.On his Twitter feed, Kaepernick curates a timeline of events that have found a place in the national discourse about race, politics and police behavior, including a protest by white supremacists in front of an N.A.A.C.P. headquarters in Houston, an article about how Arizona teenagers were forced by their school to change out of their Black Lives Matters shirts, and the fatal police shooting of an armed black man in Milwaukee.“There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder,” he said.Kaepernick, who is biracial and was adopted by white parents, said he had discussed his feelings with his family and, after months of witnessing recent civil unrest, he decided to be more active, according to the NFL Media report.He said he had not informed the team of his intentions.“This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,” he said. “I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed.”He continued, “If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.”In a statement, the 49ers said the pregame presentation of the national anthem was an opportunity to honor the country and the liberties afforded to its citizens.“In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem,” the team said.And the league said in a statement, “Players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem.”Kaepernick was not asked about his decision in the news conference after the game, which Green Bay won 21-10, The San Jose Mercury News reported in a blog post. It noted that Kaepernick sat in front of the water coolers on the sideline while his teammates stood during the national anthem.Kaepernick did not play in the first two exhibitions because of a sore throwing shoulder. An NFL Network reporter said, however, that Kaepernick had also remained seated during the anthem before those games.
