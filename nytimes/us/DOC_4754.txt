WASHINGTON, April 3 â€” In a rare moment of high constitutional drama, Vice President Dick Cheney broke a tie in the evenly divided Senate this afternoon in a dispute over President Bush's tax-and-spending proposals.Democrats wanted to reduce Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts to pay for Medicare prescription drug coverage. All 50 Democrats voted to reduce the cuts, and all 50 Republicans backed the president.That left the vice president to exercise his constitutional power to break the tie in the president's favor, and he did.This afternoon's vote was far, far from the last word on Mr. Bush's fiscal blueprint that he says will bring about $1.6 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade. The blueprint, which is more significant at this point as a statement of political and social priorities than as a realistic spending program, has already been backed by the Republican-controlled House and will doubtless undergo changes in conferences that lie ahead.Today's tie-breaker was a vivid reminder of the precarious advantage that Republicans hold in the Senate, especially since one Republican Senator, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, is 98 and ailing. If Mr. Thurmond had to be replaced, the Governor of South Carolina, Jim Hodges, would probably name a Democrat, since Mr. Hodges himself is a Democrat.
