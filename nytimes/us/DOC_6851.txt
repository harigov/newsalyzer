If prosecutors have their way, Dean G. Skelos, the former majority leader of the New York State Senate, will be sentenced to about 12 to 15 years in prison for his conviction on federal corruption charges in December.The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, made its request in a sentencing memorandum filed Monday with Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan.The prosecution also told Judge Wood that a sentence of about 10 to 12 years was necessary for Mr. Skelos’s son, Adam, 33, who was convicted along with his father in the corruption trial.Mr. Bharara’s office said that for Dean Skelos, in particular, such a sentence would be “just punishment,” given that his crime involved “an egregious and long-running abuse of power for financial gain by one of the highest-ranking and most powerful public officials in New York State.”Mr. Skelos, 68, who forfeited his Senate seat upon his conviction, stepped down from his leadership post after his arrest in May.The government also said the judge should impose a fine on the former senator of more than $350,000, noting that he had amassed a net worth of more than $2 million during his tenure in the Senate and had applied to the state for a pension of almost $96,000 annually.Lawyers for Dean and Adam Skelos have asked Judge Wood to allow their clients to avoid prison and instead serve sentences of probation and community service. Both men are scheduled to be sentenced on April 28.
