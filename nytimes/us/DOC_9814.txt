THE complex breakup of AT&T could become a bit less complicated today when the company plans to complete its spinoff of AT&T Wireless to shareholders.Under the transaction, AT&T shareholders who opted last month not to exchange all of their shares for AT&T Wireless stock will receive about a third of a share in the wireless company for each share they own of AT&T.The closing price of AT&T Wireless stock on Friday, $17.15, values the entire transaction at about $19.4 billion.The spinoff is the first of two as AT&T proceeds with the plan announced last fall to break itself into four companies: AT&T Wireless, AT&T Broadband, AT&T Business and AT&T Consumer. Shares of the consumer business will trade as a tracking stock of the business operation.Analysts are not overwhelmingly optimistic for the near term for AT&T Wireless, considering the doldrums in the wireless business and the problems that continue to bedevil AT&T itself. Still, the spinoff does potentially have positive consequences for AT&T Wireless, the nation's third-largest cellular telephone company, and its parent, AT&T, the mammoth provider of long-distance and cable-communications services.To begin with, AT&T Wireless will become the largest publicly traded wireless company in the United States, part of the S.& P. 500 index. The shares will give investors a big pure play in wireless -- a leading position that the stock is expected to occupy for some time, given the hesitance of the Verizon Wireless unit of Verizon and Cingular Wireless -- a partnership of SBC Communications and BellSouth -- to proceed with stock offerings while the demand for such securities remains relatively weak.The new independence from its former parent may also allow AT&T Wireless to more nimbly compete during this time of rapid change and upheaval in the wireless industry.''AT&T Wireless will not have to consult with the immense management structure of AT&T before acting,'' Luiz F. Carvalho, wireless analyst at Morgan Stanley, said. ''This is a liberating factor.''Moreover, AT&T Wireless will have greater flexibility to form alliances with large operators abroad, where the wider adoption of wireless services has spurred the growth of the world's largest communications companies: Vodafone P.L.C. of Britain and NTT DoCoMo of Japan. NTT DoCoMo already acquired a minority stake in AT&T Wireless last year for $10 billion.And yet, in the short term, the completion of the spinoff is not expected to breathe much life into shares of AT&T Wireless.In fact, the transaction is seen as increasing the gloom that has surrounded the stock since it made its debut in April 2000 -- the largest initial stock offering ever -- as a tracking stock of AT&T, at a price of $29.50. Since then the stock has fallen by 41.9 percent.Some of the pessimism surrounding the spinoff is related to continuing problems at AT&T. In an effort to reduce its debt, which stands at $47 billion, AT&T is retaining about $3 billion of AT&T Wireless stock to sell in the months ahead. The eventual  unloading of these shares could further depress the stock price of AT&T Wireless, said Mr. Carvalho.Already, AT&T, as part of this plan, has informed the Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to sell $1.3 billion of its holdings in AT&T Wireless through two large investment banks, Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman, Sachs & Company.Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs will offer the shares mostly to fund managers whose portfolios are primarily based on stock indexes, AT&T said in the S.E.C. filings.It is also unclear how many AT&T investors will want to hang on to their shares in AT&T Wireless since the companies are so different. AT&T has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend, for example. But AT&T Wireless plans to offer no dividend, appealing to investors interested in fast revenue growth instead of stable and steady income.When AT&T offered its shareholders a small premium last month to exchange their shares for stock in AT&T Wireless, only 372.2 million shares of AT&T were swapped for 437.7 million shares in the wireless company. In today's transaction, AT&T plans to distribute 1.13 billion shares of AT&T Wireless to its investors.''We might see disruption as some investors find themselves in a constituency they're not comfortable with,'' Sharon Ambrust, telecommunications analyst at Kagan World Media, said. Still, it may take a while for these investors to sell their AT&T Wireless stock, she said. The recent performance of AT&T Wireless stock already reflects some of these concerns.It is another issue altogether, of course, how today's spinoff affects the fortunes of AT&T. Some investors might be surprised to learn that the market value of AT&T Wireless, after the spinoff, will rival that of its former parent, giving credence to the idea that AT&T's disparate parts are worth more than its whole.But bigger surprises may be in store as AT&T proceeds with its breakup into four companies.It is unclear for now, for example, how AT&T Business will be affected by the unraveling of Concert, AT&T's $7 billion joint venture with British Telecommunications that provides large corporations with communications services. The two companies have recently discussed abandoning the venture, which would effectively fold Concert's operations back into the parent companies.In a letter sent to AT&T last week, British Telecom said its approval was required for the breakup. AT&T responded in a statement that the issues raised by British Telecom were not new and that they would not prevent or delay the restructuring.More closely watched is AT&T Broadband, the cable television and high-speed Internet business, which received a $44.5 billion merger offer yesterday from Comcast.AT&T Broadband had $8.4 billion of revenue last year, only 13 percent of AT&T's overall sales, and lost $5.4 billion. But its collection of cable properties -- the nation's largest -- which was put together through a $100 billion buying spree led by the chairman of AT&T, C. Michael Armstrong, makes it attractive to cable companies.Before the offer, AT&T's plans called for it to sell shares in the unit by the fall as a tracking stock before completely spinning off the company in a process similar to the separation of AT&T Wireless.
