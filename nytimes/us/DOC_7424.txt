President Bush announced today that the United States would rejoin the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which it quit 18 years ago in a dispute over mismanagement and cold war politics.Administration officials said the president chose to announce the decision in his speech today as he rallied support from the General Assembly for a confrontation with Iraq because the timing seemed perfect to prove that the United States was serious about the United Nations.One official said that Secretary General Kofi Annan had expressed particular gratitude to Mr. Bush, seeing the move as making good on Mr. Bush's past pledges to strengthen the United Nations. ''Kofi was ecstatic,'' this official said.Reaction from Unesco's director general, Koichiro Matsuura, was equally positive. Pointing out that as a founding member of the group, the United States had helped ''shape its 1945 Constitution upholding fundamental human rights, the free flow of ideas and information,'' he offered ''full commitment'' to reintegrating the United States ''into the life and work of the organization.''Such good will was in short supply in the 1980's, when Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal presided over Unesco, with Soviet bloc and third world nations squared off against other members in pursuit of what they called a ''new order'' in economic and communication matters.Officials in the Reagan administration saw the organization -- which had been set up to fight intolerance through the exchange of information -- as plagued by inept management, unrestrained spending and anti-American polemics.Britain and Singapore followed the United States' lead, quitting in the mid-80's.Ten years later, Britain rejoined, and under President Bill Clinton, the United States came close. But Mr. Clinton, citing the budget, put off the decision.
