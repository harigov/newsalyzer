A Manhattan appeals court ruled on Thursday in two separate lawsuits that a long-established but contentious provision of the New York civil rights code prevents the disciplinary records of city police officers from being publicly released.The twin rulings by the First Judicial Department appeals court handed a victory to Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York Police Department, both of which had argued, sometimes grudgingly, that the state civil rights law, known as Section 50-a, forbids the public issuance or mention in court of an officer’s personnel record without judicial approval.Though the law was put in place in 1976 mainly to safeguard the privacy of officers, and to shield them from the abuse that might arise if their records were released, two civil rights groups and a host of media organizations had sought to obtain such records, claiming in separate suits that the Police Department’s disciplinary process was overly secretive and that making the records of police officers public would increase accountability and transparency.The appeals court’s first decision put to rest litigation filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which in 2010 had sent a Freedom of Information request to the Police Department seeking a decade’s worth of judicial decisions as well as the outcome of the internal trials of police officers accused of misconduct.Under the department’s disciplinary process, the in-house trials of police officers are open to the public, but their final dispositions are never released.While the court wrote in its ruling that it agreed “that the public has a compelling interest in ensuring that” the city took “effective steps to monitor and discipline police officers,” it also said that Section 50-a forestalled the release of the documents that the N.Y.C.L.U. had asked for. “The remedy,” the ruling added, “must come not from this court, but from the legislature,” which had the power to change the law.Chris Dunn, the lawyer who filed the suit for the civil liberties union, said he planned to appeal the court’s ruling, adding that he looked forward to “having the state’s highest court confront the issue of the public’s right to know about the N.Y.P.D.’s disciplinary practices.”The court’s second ruling ended a suit by the Legal Aid Society, which had sought the release of the disciplinary records from the Civilian Complaint Review Board of one officer in particular: Daniel Pantaleo, who had placed Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in a chokehold moments before he died on a Staten Island sidewalk in July 2014. Despite the fact that Officer Pantaleo’s C.C.R.B. records were leaked to the media this month, the court ruled that Section 50-a did not permit their legal release and that only the state legislature could fix the law to allow the records to be made public.The court also noted that Officer Pantaleo had already received threats stemming from his role in the death of Mr. Garner, 43, and that the release of his records might increase the hostility he faced. “We find that the gravity of the threats to Officer Pantaleo’s safety nonetheless demonstrate that disclosure carries a substantial and realistic potential for harm, particularly in the form of harassment and reprisals,” the court wrote, adding that “the nondisclosure of the requested records under Civil Rights Law 50-a is warranted.”In a statement issued Thursday, Tina Luongo, the attorney in charge of Legal Aid’s criminal practice, said that even though Officer Pantaleo’s records had been leaked, she was “disappointed with the court’s view” that his C.C.R.B. file “falls under 50-a, and therefore should be protected.” Just last week, Legal Aid lawyers held arguments in court on a similar but broader suit, seeking the release of all the Police Department’s disciplinary summaries from the last five years. Ms. Luongo said she was “confident” that the broader suit would “prevail.”For months now, Mr. de Blasio has received withering criticism for taking a position on Section 50-a that is more or less identical to the one the court staked out in its rulings on Thursday. Over and again, he has said that City Hall and the Police Department have no choice but to obey Section 50-a, even though he has acknowledged that the law is flawed and he wants to work with state legislators to amend it.“In two separate unanimous decisions, the Appellate Division has reaffirmed the well-established legal principle that records generated by the police disciplinary process are protected from disclosure by 50-a,” Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said in a statement issued Thursday. “While we advocate for a state legislative change that would increase the transparency of the police disciplinary process, today’s decisions make clear that we must adhere to the law as it currently exists.”
