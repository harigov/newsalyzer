Dear Diary:Fifty years ago, my boyfriend, who is now my husband, saw me to the door of my apartment on the 28th floor of my building. He had imbibed quite a bit more than I at dinner and asked if he could have coffee.He settled himself on my high-riser bed while I went to the kitchen to make the coffee. On my return, I found him in a deep, drunken sleep. I had to resign myself to trying to sleep on a lounge chair that night.At around 5 a.m., I was aware that this man was waking up. I quickly got up myself and told him in no uncertain terms exactly what I thought of him.Knowing that my doorman would come to a conclusion I did not want if he went out through the front door, I told him that he had to walk down to the 27th floor, take the elevator to the basement and leave by way of the garage.He looked at me in utter disbelief.“If I walk through the hallway backward,” he said, “people will think I’m coming!”My anger dissipated, I made him breakfast, and four months later, we married.
