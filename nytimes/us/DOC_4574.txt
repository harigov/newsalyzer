The professional comedians and aspiring joke writers who filled their Twitter feeds with 140-character submissions for “@midnight With Chris Hardwick,” the Comedy Central late-night series, can go to bed a little earlier now: The network said on Wednesday that it is canceling the series and that its final episode will be shown on Aug. 4.“@midnight,” hosted by Mr. Hardwick, the comic and M.C. of programs like “The Talking Dead,” made its debut in 2013. Each night, in a format resembling game shows like “Jeopardy!”, it invited a panel of three celebrity contestants to riff on topical subjects and participate in “hashtag games,” proposing offbeat entries for categories like #HipsterBooks and #CowSongs. Home viewers with too much time on their hands could post their own suggestions on Twitter, too.Despite its title, “@midnight” had been airing most nights at 11:30 p.m. the past 10 months, as Comedy Central reshuffled its lineup following the August 2016 cancellation of “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore,” which ran in that time slot. (On Thursday nights, the network airs “The President Show” at 11:30.)Comedy Central said that the cancellation of “@midnight,” first reported on Deadline.com, was at the mutual agreement of the network and Mr. Hardwick, who is also an executive producer of the program. Though the show’s ratings rose after its move to the earlier time slot, viewership has since leveled off. This fall, Comedy Central is expected to introduce a new 11:30 p.m. program hosted by Jordan Klepper, a correspondent on “The Daily Show.”
