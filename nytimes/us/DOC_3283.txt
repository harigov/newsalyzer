LONDON — Unilever said on Wednesday that it was conducting a “comprehensive review” of its options after Kraft Heinz withdrew a $143 billion takeover bid for the consumer goods company on Sunday.The combination of the two companies would have created a giant in the packaged food and consumer goods industry, selling a wide range of items, including Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer meats, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Dove soap.Kraft Heinz, itself the product of mega-merger, publicly announced on Friday that it had offered to buy Unilever. It would have paid Unilever shareholders $50 a share in a combination of cash and stock.But Kraft Heinz’s board — including Warren E. Buffett and the Brazilian-born billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann — decided to withdraw the offer less than 48 hours later as it faced a potential lengthy fight for Unilever, an important company in British and Dutch business.On Wednesday, Unilever said it was reviewing potential options available to “accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders.” It said it hoped to complete the review by April.“The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever,” the company said in a news release.Unilever did not provide additional details on what those options might be.Following the announcement, shares of Unilever rose 3 percent in London and in Amsterdam in midafternoon trading.On Friday, Kraft Heinz publicly announced it had made a bid for Unilever, but the consumer goods company had rejected the offer. At the time, it said it was hopeful it could “reach agreement on the terms of a transaction.”The disclosure came after a report in The Financial Times’s Alphaville blog said the two companies had held talks.Unilever quickly responded that the offer — an 18 percent premium to its closing share price on Thursday — “fundamentally undervalues” the company.The transaction, if it had been completed, would have been the largest cross-border merger since the British wireless provider Vodafone’s $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann of Germany in 2000.Politicians in Britain and the Netherlands also raised concerns about the potential impact of a Kraft Heinz-Unilever combination on jobs in both countries.Kraft had previously faced scrutiny in Britain for its actions after its takeover of Cadbury in 2010, particularly after it backtracked on plans to keep a plant open in Keynsham, England.The merger prompted a change in takeover laws in Britain.Cadbury was included as part of the spinoff of Mondelez International two years later.Kraft Heinz was created two years ago in a deal driven by 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that partnered with Mr. Buffett in 2013 to buy Heinz.The withdrawal of Kraft Heinz’s offer sent Unilever shares down sharply on Monday after they had jumped 15 percent in trading on Friday.
