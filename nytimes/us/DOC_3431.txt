To the Editor:Re “Dutch Face Rising Seas. The World Is Watching” (“Changing Climate, Changing Cities,” front page, June 16):Michael Kimmelman is correct in his assessment of climate change as a business in the Netherlands. Rotterdam, vying for distinction from glamorous Amsterdam, has seized an opportunity to position itself as a pioneer in climate change and flood adaptation planning. I would also stress the extent to which this rebranding is a boon to the city.Delegations do come to Rotterdam frequently, and Dutch planners, designers and engineers are favored worldwide for their seemingly innate ability to manage water. But it is important to consider who foots the bill for these transactions.The Dutch government, with a large budget for international activities, pays for many of them. While these relationships improve Rotterdam’s branding, the actual economic gain they incur is quite small in comparison with the city’s port-related industries.To monetize their expertise, the Dutch need to take a different approach to these international activities.DOROTHY B. MACAUSLANDNEW YORKThe writer’s master’s thesis in urban planning at Columbia University was about the export of Dutch flood management expertise and its effects on Rotterdam.
