Proximity to Manhattan and Chinese food were among the lures when Lawrence and Crystal Tsang moved from a cramped rental on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to the affluent Great Neck peninsula on the North Shore of Long Island in late 2014.“The commute was great, nonstop to Penn Station in 24 minutes,” said Mr. Tsang, 40, who works in information technology; Ms. Tsang, 32, is a banker in Midtown. Also, “It was pretty close to Flushing, Queens, which has a lot of Chinese food.”The couple paid $865,000 for a 1948 house in the village of Great Neck with three bedrooms, two and a half baths, a screened porch and a one-car garage on nearly 0.2 acre, close to a park with a duck pond.“It wasn’t cheap, but we liked what we saw,” he said. “It’s a nice town, and we liked the house a lot.” Great Neck’s stellar school district was another plus, as the Tsangs are now parents of a 6-month-old girl.The Great Neck peninsula encompasses nine villages and several unincorporated areas within the Town of North Hempstead in northwest Nassau County. It has roughly 40,000 residents across 9.6 square miles, and is dotted with more than 20 parks and surrounded by Little Neck Bay, Long Island Sound and Manhasset Bay. Verdant residential areas ring the more densely packed village of Great Neck Plaza, with the Long Island Rail Road station at its core.One fairly recent transplant, Linda Szenicer, 56, came to Great Neck Plaza seeking “a change of scenery” after a lifetime in Lawrence, N.Y., on the South Shore of Long Island. Three years ago, she sold her five-bedroom colonial there for $900,000, downsizing to a $340,000 two-bedroom one-bath co-op in Great Neck Plaza.That first apartment proved too small, but she loved the neighborhood. In November, she moved into a $475,000 two-bedroom two-bath unit next to a park with a gazebo.“It’s a pretty town, very picturesque, bursting with beautiful flowers everywhere,” said Ms. Szenicer, adding that she also appreciates the easy stroll to the train, shops and restaurants, and the “diverse population.”Alice Kasten, president of the Great Neck Historical Society, said the peninsula’s demographics have changed “a great deal” over the last 30 years, as the number of Orthodox Jews and Iranian and other Middle Eastern Jews living there has swelled. The Great Neck peninsula has more than 20 synagogues.“Many times, when a business goes out, you can expect a temple to come in,” Ms. Kasten said.More recently, she said, there has been a sizable Asian influx that includes Chinese and Koreans from Flushing. Many newcomers come “for their religious institutions, whether a Babylonian temple” — an Iraqi Jewish congregation — “or a Korean church.”Carol Chang, an agent with Laffey Fine Homes in Great Neck, moved to the south side of the peninsula from Queens eight years ago. She describes it as “a melting pot” of many countries and cultures, and “a very family-oriented community” with numerous multigenerational families.Ms. Chang’s 14- and 11-year-old “always want to go to town,” she said, meaning in and around Great Neck Plaza, “where most of the kids hang out.”She added: “I feel very comfortable with the pizzeria, the supermarket, Chipotle — it’s all familiar people, familiar faces.”The Great Neck peninsula starts south of the Long Island Expressway in Lake Success and runs to affluent Kings Point at the northern tip. Lakeville Road, the main north-south artery, which becomes Middle Neck Road north of Northern Boulevard, is lined with apartments, shops, restaurants and houses of worship.The heart of the peninsula, the village of Great Neck Plaza, has 49 co-ops, 19 condominiums, 30 rental buildings, 48 single-family homes, several senior residential options and two boutique hotels, said Jean Celender, the mayor.Since the recession, many of the Plaza’s 260 storefronts have changed from boutiques and other stores to “personal services that you can’t do on a smartphone,” Mayor Celender said, such as Launchpad, a co-working space. Nail and hair salons abound, and there are around 45 food establishments. A new mixed-use development with retail and 30 apartments is rising on Grace Avenue.In the villages of Great Neck Estates, Russell Gardens and Kensington, large older colonials and Tudors are juxtaposed with even grander new ones. In Saddle Rock, large waterfront houses supplant split-levels. Thomaston, on Great Neck’s biggest hill, blends single-family homes, apartment buildings and condos.In the village of Great Neck, Avalon Great Neck is under construction with 191 rental apartments, said Mayor Pedram Bral. Pre-leasing prices range from $2,700 for a one-bedroom to $4,925 for a three-bedroom.Andrea Levine, the broker-owner of Keller Williams Realty Gold Coast, using data from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, said 209 houses, 103 co-ops and 23 condos were for sale on the Great Neck peninsula on July 25.Listings on the high end ranged from $1,701,000 for a six-bedroom ranch on an acre to $100 million for a three-house waterfront compound on eight acres; the second-priciest listing was $18,888,888, for a six-bedroom waterfront house on 4.54 acres.Mid-range homes, from $801,000 to $1,700,000, are highly desirable, Ms. Levine said, with an average sales price of $1,100,844 in the first half of 2016, up from $1,074,302 in the same period last year. Houses for $800,000 or less, for which inventory is low, had an average sales price of $682,344 in the first half of 2016.The average list price on July 25 for condos was $994,435 and for co-ops, $307,686, Ms. Levine said. Rentals range from $2,100 a month for a one-bedroom apartment to $6,800 a month for a five-bedroom house on an acre.The Parkwood Sports Complex has an Olympic-size pool and intermediate and children’s pools. A family pass is $400. Access is limited to residents of the Great Neck Park District, which includes six villages. The indoor recreation center, open Memorial Day to Labor Day, becomes an ice-skating rink available to the public the rest of the year.Hiking trails, picnic areas, tennis courts and sports fields are spread across 175-acre Kings Point Park. Steppingstone Park, on Long Island Sound, includes a marina, a sailing school, a fishing dock and an aqua park. A Great Neck Park District park card is required to enter both.The Great Neck Library has four locations. The multiplex on Middle Neck Road has seven screens.Great Neck Public Schools, with 6,132 students, serve Great Neck, North New Hyde Park and part of Manhasset Hills. The district has a universal prekindergarten, four elementary schools, two middle schools, two high schools, an alternative high school and two adult learning centers.Average SAT scores for the class of 2015 at John L. Miller Great Neck North High School were 566 in critical reading, 596 in math and 583 in writing, while William A. Shine Great Neck South High School averaged 583, 630 and 590, compared with state scores of 489, 502 and 478.The North Shore Hebrew Academy, a private Jewish day school, has 1,286 students on three campuses in Great Neck. SAT scores for 2015 were 627 in reading, 659 in math and 637 in writing.The United States Merchant Marine Academy is in Kings Point.The 7:47 a.m. Long Island Rail Road train from Great Neck station is scheduled to reach Penn Station in 24 minutes; a monthly pass is $252. The drive to Midtown Manhattan can take as little as 30 minutes.In the 1920s, the peninsula was home to a celebrity crowd. The comedian Groucho Marx had a house in Thomaston. The songwriter George M. Cohan wrote “Over There” while living on Kings Point Road. The lyricist, librettist and producer Oscar Hammerstein owned a Tudor-style house in Kings Point.
