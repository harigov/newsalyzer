Do you feel prepared to enter the world of adulthood? What sorts of skills and habits do you think you need to be a successful, self-sufficient adult?Make a list of the emotional, academic and daily functioning skills you think adulthood requires.In “Preparing ‘Emerging Adults’ for College and Beyond,” Alina Tugend writes:Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:— How many of the skills listed in the article do you think you already do well, and why?— Do you think the lists are complete? Is there anything you would add to the lists in the article, or would you add another category? What would you add, if so, and why?— Do you think you are ready to be an adult? Why or why not?_________A note from the Learning Network: This is our last new Student Opinion question until mid-August, when we return with many of our regular features.Instead, for the next 10 weeks this question will become part of our Summer Reading Contest, which runs from June 16-Aug. 25 and is open any week to any teenager anywhere in the world. We’ll be asking, “What interested you most in The Times this week? Why?” To enter, all you have to do is post an answer._________Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.
