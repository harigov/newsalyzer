SeaWorld said on Monday that it planned to phase out next year its San Diego killer whale performance, a central point for criticism of how its animals are treated.The company, which also has parks in Orlando, Fla., and San Antonio, said in a company document posted on Monday that it would replace its theatrical Shamu show in San Diego with an “informative” experience that has a “conservation message inspiring people to act.”The announcement does not affect shows with orcas at the parks in Texas and Florida, said Fred Jacobs, a company spokesman.SeaWorld has been under heavy scrutiny since “Blackfish,” a documentary that criticized the park’s treatment of orcas, was released in 2013, and attendance has suffered.The pressure to stop using the orcas as performers has been particularly intense in California. On Friday, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said he would introduce a bill in Congress that would prohibit the breeding, wild capture and import or export of the whales.In October, the California Coastal Commission banned the breeding of killer whales in captivity, a decision SeaWorld said was an overreach of the agency’s authority. The commission attached the ban to its approval of a proposed expansion of SeaWorld’s whale habitat in San Diego.In a presentation to investors, Joel Manby, SeaWorld’s president and chief executive, said the decision to end the performances was not based on public criticism, as “activists aren’t going to be pleased with anything we do.” But he said guests in San Diego had expressed changing tastes, adding that they wanted a more natural experience simulating how whales would behave in the wild and that they didn’t like actions that appeared to be tricks.“We didn’t do anything in San Diego because of the activists,” Mr. Manby said. “We did it because we’re hearing it from our guests.”In a statement, Jared Goodman, the director of animal law for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said the “end to SeaWorld’s tawdry circus-style shows is inevitable and necessary,” but he called on the company to build sea sanctuaries and stop breeding orcas.“This move is like no longer whipping lions in a circus act but keeping them locked inside cages for life,” he said.Mr. Schiff, in a statement, called the decision a “welcome step” but echoed the call for sanctuaries and the end of breeding.“The fact still remains that as long as SeaWorld holds orcas in captivity, the physical and psychological problems associated with their captivity will persist,” he said.
