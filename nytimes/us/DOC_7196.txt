SEOUL, South Korea — If North Korea wanted to rattle the United States and China with its missile test this week, the launch itself was more fizzle than bang.Instead of showing off the North’s technological prowess just before President Trump was to host President Xi Jinping of China for their first summit meeting, the missile fired on Wednesday flew a mere 37 miles, according to the South Korean military.North Korea, which typically gushes over important missile tests — especially those attended by its leader, Kim Jong-un — has been silent about this one, indicating either that it was not important enough to merit Mr. Kim’s presence or that it was a failure.American and South Korean officials initially said they believed that the North had launched its Pukguksong-2, a newly developed, nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile that uses solid-fuel technology, which makes it easier for the country to hide its weapons and deploy them on short notice.But some news outlets, citing unidentified United States officials, floated a different theory: that the missile was a more mundane Scud-ER, or a Scud with an extended range, and had spun out of control and plunged into the sea nine minutes after its launch.On Thursday, South Korean and American officials stuck to their initial assessment that the missile appeared to have been a Pukguksong-2, while stressing that the finding was preliminary. “Initial assessments are just that: initial and subject to changes,” said Cmdr. Dave Benham, a spokesman for United States Pacific Command.For many analysts, neither assessment explained the short distance that the missile had traveled.Although North Korea has a spotty record with missile tests, it appeared to have mastered its skills with Scuds. The last time it tested midrange Scud-ERs, in March, it launched four of them simultaneously. They flew an average of 620 miles, some of them splashing down into waters inside Japan’s exclusive economic zone.When North Korea first tested its Pukguksong-2 in February, it was confident enough with the system to fire it from a mobile launch vehicle deep inside the country. The missile flew 310 miles across North Korea and fell into waters off its east coast.The United States Pacific Command said that the missile fired on Wednesday was a Pukguksong-2 but that it had been deployed from “a land-based facility” near Sinpo, a port on the east coast of North Korea, rather than a mobile launch vehicle inland.“If the missile launched on Wednesday was a failure, it’s hard to believe that it involved either a Pukguksong-2 or Scud-ER,” said Kim Dong-yub, a missile expert at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul.Mr. Kim said it was more reasonable to believe that the North was testing a modified version of either the Scud-ER or Pukguksong-2 or a new missile, even an early version of an intercontinental ballistic missile.When it was developing its first submarine-launched ballistic missile last year, North Korea accumulated technology incrementally, with a series of tests in which projectiles flew only short distances or exploded soon after launching, analysts said.The United States has been conducting an electronic and cyberwarfare campaign aimed at sabotaging Pyongyang’s missile tests in their opening seconds. But it was impossible to determine whether that program had affected the launch on Wednesday.South Korean analysts and military officials noted that Sinpo was where the North developed its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM, called Pukguksong-1. Pukguksong-2 was built from the SLBM.The Pukguksong series was a breakthrough for North Korea. Unlike almost all of its other ballistic missiles, including the Scuds, that use liquid fuel — which could take hours to load, a process that can usually be detected by satellites — the Pukguksong missiles use solid-fuel technology, meaning Pyongyang can hide them in its numerous tunnels and launch them on very short notice.When North Korea successfully launched its Pukguksong-2, Kim Jong-un boasted that his country’s “rocket industry has radically turned into high thrust solid fuel-powered engine from liquid fuel rocket engine.” That comment left many South Korean officials wondering whether the North was trying to modify its existing liquid-fuel missiles, including Scud-ERs, into versions with solid fuel.“Sinpo is the birthplace of North Korea’s solid-fuel technology and SLBM, and it is on the coast — and thus is a rather safer place to test a new missile whose stability is not guaranteed,” said Kim Dong-yub, the missile expert. “Whatever missile the North tested on Wednesday may have involved a new system and/or solid fuel.”The North’s Pukguksong series signaled breakthroughs in other ways.After several tests, North Korea said in August that it successfully launched its Pukguksong-1, claiming that the continental United States, as well as its military bases in the Pacific, were within striking range.Analysts and defense officials said that North Korea was still years away from achieving the capability Kim Jong-un claimed. The country still does not have submarines large and advanced enough to attack distant targets across the Pacific without being detected.After studying the Pukguksong-2 test in February, the United States Strategic Command called the missile “a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile.” But North Korea used an unfamiliar term, a “medium long-range ballistic missile,” suggesting its potential range would be longer. The successful deployment of the Pukguksong-2 would considerably extend North Korea’s capabilities.North Korea has deployed and has often successfully tested short-range Scud and midrange Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan. But it has had a hard time developing a reliable intermediate-range missile to target American bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam, which serve as launching points for American reinforcements should war break out on the Korean Peninsula.It has had a spotty record in test-launching its intermediate-range Musudan missile. North Korea was believed to have tested the Musudan last month and again failed to launch it properly. Commercial satellite imagery of the launch area showed evidence of a 360-foot-diameter explosion scar on the ground.So, when the new intermediate-range Pukguksong-2 was successfully tested in February, it was a boon for the government.South Korean officials said that whether they were botched or not, the tests of the Musudan and Pukguksong missiles gave North Korea important insights for its efforts to build an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, that could strike the United States.Some South Korean analysts and news outlets have speculated that Kim Jong-un may have deliberately shortened the range of Wednesday’s test, intending it as a precursor of what might come rather than provoking Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi outright.Depending on the outcome of their summit talks, Mr. Kim may lash out with a more provocative missile launch or even a nuclear test, they said. Citing recent satellite imagery at North Korea’s main nuclear test site, analysts said that the country might be ready for its sixth nuclear test.“North Korea wanted to send a message that it was determined to advance its nuclear and missile programs regardless of the results of the United States-China summit meeting,” said Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea. “But it was a low-intensity provocation designed not to provoke China too much.”
