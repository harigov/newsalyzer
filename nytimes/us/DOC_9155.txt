Having banned public protests, Thailand’s military faces a new challenge: how to treat citizens who make a three-fingered salute, a sign of resistance borrowed by opponents of last month’s coup from “The Hunger Games,” The Bangkok Post reported.“At this point we are monitoring the movement,” a spokesman for the junta told The Associated Press. “If it is an obvious form of resistance, then we have to control it so it doesn’t cause any disorder in the country.”The salute, inspired by a trope from the popular science-fiction fantasy, was made by dozens of opponents of military rule who gathered briefly at a mall in Bangkok on Sunday.Thais offered various explanations for the newly adopted symbol. Some referred to its meaning in the context of “The Hunger Games,” while others told reporters it stood for the French Revolution’s trinity of values, “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.”In a column for The Bangkok Post advising the leader of the junta not to crack down on protesters who make the salute, Atiya Achakulwisut explianed that things did not go well for the authorities who did so in the fictional narrative. “If Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha reads or watches ‘The Hunger Games,’ he would know that what triggered the ‘revolution’ is not the three-finger salute,” she wrote. “It’s the public execution of an old man who first responded to the sign.”Although the military has tried to enforce a ban on criticism of the coup by closing television stations and blocking websites, images and video of protesters flashing the three-fingered sign at the Terminal 21 shopping center on Sunday circulated on Facebook and Twitter.While many of the protesters managed to withdraw after registering their quiet dissent, journalists watched as at least one woman who made the sign was later forced into a taxi by plainclothes police officers.A pack of reporters also surrounded one older woman who made just the two-fingered peace sign and was hauled off by three officers in civilian dress, including one posing as a member of the news media, wearing the credentials and green armband issued to reporters by the Thai Journalists Association.As the BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher reported on Twitter, there were also references to Orwell on display during the flash-mob protest at the shopping mall on Sunday, including a banner that cast the military leader, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, as Thailand’s Big Brother.Another form of quiet dissent, in which coup protesters in small groups make a show of reading Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” and other tracts on revolution and tyranny in public was documented by Lilian Suwanrumpha, a Thai-American photographer.
