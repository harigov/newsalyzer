The AT&T Corporation announced the biggest single job cut in the history of the telephone business yesterday, and one of the largest corporate work-force reductions ever, as the company braces for a new wave of competition in the communications industry.AT&T said it would eliminate 40,000 of its 300,000 jobs over the next three years and take a $6 billion charge against earnings, all in preparation for splitting itself into three companies by the end of this year. Up to 7,000 of the cuts will occur in New Jersey, where AT&T has its headquarters at Basking Ridge. With 48,000 employees statewide, AT&T is New Jersey's largest employer.Although substantial job cuts had been expected, the number was bigger and the action will come sooner than many employees and analysts had expected. Some  70 percent of the cuts will occur before the end of the year.AT&T had set the stage for yesterday's announcement nearly two months ago, when it offered voluntary buyouts to half of the 150,000 employees in its management ranks. About 6,500 people accepted the offer, which expired on Friday; about 30,000 others are expected to be laid off involuntarily, with most of those cuts coming from management. Another 4,000 people work for AT&T subsidiaries that will be sold over the next year.AT&T had gradually eliminated nearly 100,000 jobs in the last dozen years, but yesterday's announcement that it would eliminate about 13 percent of its work force was one of the biggest cutbacks ever in any industry in a single stroke. General Motors set the record in December 1991, announcing plans to reduce its work force by 70,000 people. The second largest was the International Business Machines Corporation's announcement in July 1993 that it would eliminate 63,000 jobs.But in sharp contrast to the moves by G.M. and I.B.M., which made deep cuts after sustaining heavy damage from nimbler competitors, AT&T's decision comes when the company is healthy and when almost all segments of its business are profitable and growing.AT&T's move is part of a broader reorganization announced in September that will split the company into three separately owned concerns engaged in communications services, telecommunications equipment and computers.That broader plan, and yesterday's cutbacks, are both responses to changes that are expected to rock the communications industry over the next few years -- in particular as AT&T and other long-distance carriers prepare for the regional  Bell telephone companies to attack the $80 billion long-distance market.Intense competition is a certain outcome of the telecommunications legislation now pending in Washington. And most industry executives expect technology and market forces soon to force open the local and long-distance communications markets even if Congress cannot overcome its current impasse over the legislation."The easy thing as we see the changes taking place in our industry is to rest on our laurels and say we are going pretty well," Robert E. Allen, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday.Mr. Allen acknowledged "how wrenching it will be for employees and their families," but defended the company's decision to cut quickly and deeply. "The initiative we took is to get ahead of the game a little bit and focus on what the markets would look like two to three years hence," he said.While Wall Street cheered AT&T's action -- the company's shares rose $2.625 each, to close at $67.375 on the New York Stock Exchange -- many AT&T workers were caught by surprise, even though they had been bracing for layoffs. And union officials angrily denounced the cutbacks as a betrayal."This is yet another case of the kind of mindless job destruction that has terrorized working Americans in recent years as corporate executives play to Wall Street," said Morton Bahr, president of the Communication Workers of America, which represents 80,000 AT&T workers.Besides forcing AT&T and other long-distance carriers to gird for a fight, the prospect of new competition has forced them to begin their own counterattack on the markets for local telephone service dominated by the so-called Baby Bells.For AT&T, that means investing billions of dollars on its network so that it  can offer a full range of local, long-distance and wireless communication services. It will probably spend more than $2 billion to complete its nationwide network for wireless telephones and computers, having already spent $10 billion  to acquire McCaw Cellular Communications and large sums $1.7 billion to buy up licenses for new wireless "personal communication services."AT&T may also have to spend many billions more to build its own local telephone networks if it truly wants to attack the Bell companies on their own territory.Yesterday's announcement was probably a harbinger of more cutbacks in the telephone industry, particularly at local telephone companies. The seven Bell companies have cut tens of thousands of workers in recent years, as automation and new forms of pricing regulation have given them incentives to operate more leanly. But as the local phone companies move from being regulated monopolies to players in a competitive market, many analysts believe there is plenty of room for additional cutting.For AT&T, yesterday's announcement heralds the second big wave of layoffs since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984. From that year until 1991, when the company grew substantially through the acquisition of the NCR Corporation, AT&T had thinned its ranks by nearly 100,000 to compete with long-distance carriers like MCI Communications and equipment rivals like Northern Telecom of Canada.This time, AT&T said that 23,000 jobs would be eliminated in the communications equipment business, which is scheduled to be spun off as a separate company. An additional 17,000 cuts will come from the long-distance company, which will form the core of the corporation that will retain the AT&T name.The actual total cutback will be almost 50,000 workers, because the plans announced yesterday do not include 8,500 jobs that AT&T had already said it would eliminate from its struggling computer company, Global Information Solutions, the former NCR, which will be one of the three new companies.On the financial side, AT&T said it would take a $6 billion charge against earnings, which will reduce its after-tax earnings for the fourth quarter of 1995 by $4 billion. AT&T earned $2.82 billion in the first nine months of the year, and it may squeeze out a tiny profit for all of 1995 even after the huge write-off.But several analysts warned that the cutbacks will show up as only modest improvements for AT&T's overall profits this year -- perhaps less than 10 cents  a share, or $100 million.Some analysts also said that the biggest question remained unanswered: How much does the company plan to spend in the next few years to meet its strategic  need to offer both local and long-distance service?Daniel P. Reingold of Merrill Lynch said AT&T was more vulnerable than either MCI or Sprint to attack from the Bell companies, in part because the Bells are more likely to lease lines from MCI or Sprint for their own entry into long-distance than they are to pay AT&T for such network connections."We're still waiting for the punchline," Mr. Reingold said of AT&T.  "How are they going to get into the local market, how are they going to make money in it  and how are they going to avoid the costs and construction delays associated with building local networks?"
