WASHINGTON — President Trump escalated his attacks on the intelligence community on Thursday, promising to catch the “low-life leakers” who have supplied the “fake news media” with information on his administration’s ties to Russia, information that he dismissed as a political excuse for Democratic losses.In a Twitter rant that extended into work hours, Mr. Trump at once dismissed the entire Russia story as “fake” and made up, and pledged to hunt down the officials in the government who have supplied the details. He demanded an apology from the “failing” New York Times and accused the news media of making up stories and sources, even as he said he wanted those sources apprehended.The posts, which started around 7 a.m. and stretched past 9 a.m., appear calculated to antagonize intelligence agencies and keep supporters trained on the news media. The president is planning a campaign rally in Florida on Saturday.Republican leaders may be growing weary. In an interview with the conservative Weekly Standard, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Mr. Trump’s approval ratings — abysmal for a new president at around 40 percent — would be “10 to 15 points higher if he allowed himself to stay on message.”Mr. McConnell singled out the president’s Twitter comments. “What he’s saying makes everything harder,” the majority leader said.
