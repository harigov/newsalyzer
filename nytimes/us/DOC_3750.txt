This year’s Emmy Awards were the least-watched in the show’s history, drawing just 11.9 million viewers on Sunday night, according to Nielsen.The Emmys, which were broadcast on Fox and featured a dominant showing by HBO, were hurt by going up against NBC’s “Sunday Night Football,” which featured the Green Bay Packers and the Seattle Seahawks.The viewership for the Emmys had been trending in a positive direction in the previous two years. Last year’s show on NBC had 15.6 million viewers, and 17.8 million viewers tuned in to watch on CBS in 2013. (The show rotates among the four broadcast networks from year to year.)The previous viewing low for the Emmys was in 2008, when 12.3 million watched the awards on ABC.This year’s Emmys show, which was hosted by Andy Samberg, also had a 3.6 rating in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic, down 14 percent from last year. The 2014 Emmys were broadcast on a Monday night, and in the middle of August, in part to accommodate NBC’s football contract.But not all the viewership surrounding the show was down: E!’s “Live From the Red Carpet” broadcast drew 1.1 million viewers, up 7 percent from last year.
