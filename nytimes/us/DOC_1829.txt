From toothbrushes and towels to pens and pillow cases, you’d be hard-pressed not to find an item with Hello Kitty’s famous mug on it.The proof, in fact, is in the dumpling.Hong Kong’s first Kitty-dedicated Chinese restaurant opened this month, and those wee whiskers and bow appear atop dumplings (squid ink is used for the eyes, natural food coloring for the bow) and noodles (shredded egg forms the bow in this dish).And late last year a Hello Kitty teahouse made its debut in Kyoto with a similarly styled dim sim menu and matcha green tea lattes. A winter special: hot chocolate with Kitty’s boyfriend Daniel fashioned out of marshmallows and foam.The 40-seat cafe is officially called the Hello Kitty Tea Shop and is open every day from 10:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. It is located between two of Kyoto’s most popular sightseeing spots, the Kiyomizu-dera Buddhist temple and the Yasaka Shrine.Inside the cafe, Hello Kitty is everywhere, from the porcelain bowls and napkins to the tables and white booths, which are adorned with a pattern of the signature bow. (The Japanese company Sanrio created the character in 1974.)Additional menu items include the Namafu parfait with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a cookie with Kitty on it, and sweet green tea soup and chestnut soup, both of which come with floating rice cakes made in the likeness of the friendly feline.
