Here are some disturbing things we have learned since December, when the nations of the world reached a landmark agreement in Paris to lower greenhouse gas emissions.In January, scientists reported that 2015 was by far the hottest year on record, and another record could be set this year.In February, a Princeton-based research organization said the tidal flooding that has already made life miserable for people in coastal cities like Miami and Charleston is getting steadily worse.In mid-March, a group of experts, including James Hansen, the retired scientist who first brought the perils of climate change to Congress’s attention in 1988, warned that shifts in climate could be sudden and abrupt, giving humanity little time to prepare for flooding, severe droughts and other upheavals.Now comes another scary prediction: If carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels continue unabated, the vast West Antarctic ice sheet could begin to disintegrate, causing the sea to rise by five to six feet by the end of the century, destroying coastal cities and low-lying island nations and creating environmental devastation within the lifetimes of children born today.The startling new finding was published Wednesday in the journal Nature by two experts in ice-sheet behavior: Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University. It paints a grimmer picture than the one presented only three years ago by a United Nations panel that forecast a maximum sea level rise of three feet by 2100. But that projection assumed only a minimal contribution from the massive ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. And things could get worse in the centuries to come — the melting from Antarctica alone, not counting other factors like thermal expansion, could cause the seas to rise by nearly 50 feet by 2500, drowning many cities.But the report also contains what passes for good news nowadays: The collapse of Antarctica is not inevitable, it says, and could be prevented with an aggressive global effort to keep greenhouse gases at or below the levels called for in Paris, where leaders embraced a goal of holding warming “well below” an increase of two degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels.But the pledges made by individual countries will not come close to meeting those targets, which means a great deal more work lies ahead for all nations — particularly big emitters like China, the European Union and the United States — to avoid trigger points at which the big ice sheets will begin to melt.It also means that the United States must continue to exercise leadership, which has suddenly been cast into doubt by the presidential campaign and the Supreme Court. President Obama has done his part, moving aggressively to increase automobile efficiency, develop cleaner sources of energy and impose strict new limits on greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants. The power plant rule in particular was crucial to securing agreements from other big coal users like China and India, and was important to the success of the Paris conference. But in February, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to block that rule, pending a decision on its merits in a lower court.In the meantime, Republican congressional leaders like Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, have been doing their best to make sure that King Coal reigns forever. Though the Democratic candidates take global warming seriously, the two leading Republican candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, who don’t have a rudimentary grasp of the subject, are not only criticizing Mr. Obama’s initiatives but also questioning or denying the science of climate change.
