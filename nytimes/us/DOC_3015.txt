(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. Senate Republican leaders released their latest version of the health care bill.Despite concessions by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the measure was immediately imperiled when two key Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, above, and Rand Paul of Kentucky, rebuffed it.One other health note: A new study found high concentrations of phthalates, hormone disrupters that can be especially damaging to children, in the highly processed cheese powder in boxed mac and cheese._____2. President Trump is visiting Paris for Bastille Day celebrations honoring the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I.The visit appears to be smoothing over an initially strange and tense relationship with President Emmanuel Macron, and possibly vaulting France ahead of Britain and Germany as a point of U.S. contact.But Mr. Trump’s domestic troubles accompanied him. In comments made to reporters on Air Force One en route to Paris, he said of Donald Trump Jr.: “He’s a good boy. He’s a good kid. And he had a meeting, nothing happened with the meeting.” In Paris, a video of Mr. Trump telling Brigitte Macron, the French president’s wife, that she was “in such good shape” and “beautiful” was widely spread online.Comedians continue to riff on the Paris meeting. Here’s our Best of Late Night roundup._____3. Liu Xiaobo, China’s most prominent political prisoner and a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, died, still silenced and under guard at a government hospital.Mr. Liu, who kept vigil on Tiananmen Square in 1989 to protect protesters from soldiers and initiated a prominent petition for democracy, had been jailed since being convicted in 2009 of inciting subversion. His fate reflects how human rights issues have receded in Western diplomacy with China._____4. “We had no documents, no nothing; we had left everything behind.”A family of refugees — among the last to enter the country before President Trump’s moratorium went into effect today — told our reporter how they fled Congo in 2009 after a militia attacked them, and lived for years in a refugee camp in Malawi until finally making it to Arkansas.For the next 120 days, only refugees who have a “bona fide relationship” with a close relative or entity in the United States will be eligible to enter._____5. The Justice Department charged 412 people nationwide, including dozens of doctors, in schemes that collectively defrauded the government of about $1.3 billion. Nearly one-third were accused of opioid-related crimes.Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50. Above, medics respond to an overdose. Our magazine looked at one small-town police officer’s war on drugs.And we reviewed three new books that explore the opioid epidemic and how to help those afflicted by addiction._______6. Sheldon Silver will have to be retried.In a surprise move, an appellate court overturned the iconic Albany power broker’s 2015 conviction for extensive corruption, which drew a 12-year sentence that he has not yet begun to serve.The appellate court said that the judge had given erroneous instructions to the jury, citing a Supreme Court ruling last year involving the former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell that made it harder to convict public officials._______7. The competition to lead Uber is robust, despite a year of scandals. Above, Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco.Here’s a look at the hiring process, and some of the intriguing candidates. “Yes, they’re inheriting Uber’s entire toxic culture,” an executive headhunter said. “But they’re also getting thousands of employees who are hungry to change it.”Other workplaces are shifting into a new kind of disruptive model. “Flash organizations,” modeled on the film world’s temporary assemblies of freelancers, are finding their way into fields like software and pharmaceuticals._______8. We enlisted our international photographer Adam Ferguson to help us expand our coverage of his native Australia.He spent three months exploring its vast interior, and came back with portraits of remote, fascinating landscapes and the slow erosion of traditional ways of life for ranchers, miners — even crocodile farmers. An Aboriginal community leader showed him how to suck the sweetness from honey ants.The outback has “become a kind of myth,” he said in a Q. and A. after returning to his base in New York. “And the point of the trip, for me, was to inquire what that myth has now become.”_______9. Venus Williams is heading to her ninth Wimbledon final.She upset Britain’s top female player, sixth-seeded Johanna Konta, in the semifinal. Williams, the 10th seed, will play No. 14 Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain on Saturday, her first finals appearance since 2009.For the men’s singles semifinals on Friday, Sam Querrey plays Marin Cilic, and Roger Federer faces Tomas Berdych._______10. And the nominees are…“Saturday Night Live” and “Westworld, ” above, led the pack with 22 nominations each for the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards. HBO received a total of 110 nominations, with a close second by Netflix with 91 nominations.Our critics weighed in on whether Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of President Trump is worth a supporting actor nod and considered the snubs in a year of “really good” TV. The awards ceremony comes Sept. 17._______11. Explore the arks of the apocalypse. Our magazine looks at how scientists around the world are building repositories of everything — from seeds to ice to mammal milk — in a race to preserve a natural order that is fast disappearing under the weight of human impact.Take our quiz to find out the one climate solution that’s more effective than others.Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
