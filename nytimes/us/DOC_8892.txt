ALTHOUGH it has become fashionable to grill pizza,  there is at least one traditional, mostly whole grain, unyeasted bread that is tailor-made for the grill. Foolproof and not much work, it is chapati, the Indian flatbread that can be served with almost anything you have going on the fire.Chapati dough can be made in the food processor in less than a minute; unlike doughs made with yeast, it needs no time to rise, though it does benefit from at least a half hour of resting before cooking.There are other advantages. Handling the dough is pretty much trouble-free. A bit of surface flour applied when needed instantly deals with stickiness. It can be wrapped and left in the fridge for a full day.When you’re ready to grill,  just tear off walnut- to golf-ball-size pieces, roll them out with a little flour (if you have a tortilla press handy, it would speed things up a bit) and toss onto the grill. They’ll puff up and brown in a minute; turn and brown the other side and they’re done. You can deal with a whole batch, from starting to roll to completing the grilling, in 15 minutes or less.And because you’re starting with a food processor, additions are nearly effortless. I especially like  thyme leaves, a little garlic, fresh or dried chilies, or chopped onion; this last I’d add by hand, because it’s a shame to lose its crunch.It’s also perfectly acceptable to brush the chapatis with a little olive oil or melted butter while they’re grilling. Toppings? I suppose, but then you’re in pizza territory.
