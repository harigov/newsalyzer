RALEIGH, N.C. — Three weeks after Election Day, the North Carolina governor’s race remains an unresolved, hotly contested muddle. The Democratic challenger, Roy Cooper, has declared victory. But the Republican incumbent, Pat McCrory, trailing by thousands of votes in the as-yet-unfinished tally, has refused to concede, as he and his allies charge that the election was marred by numerous irregularities.Mr. McCrory’s foes are furious. Last week, they parked a U-Haul truck in front of the governor’s mansion and waved moving boxes adorned with the face of Ray Charles as they sang, “Hit the Road, Pat.” On Monday evening, hundreds gathered at the state Capitol, shouting, “No stealing our election!”The North Carolina imbroglio is so complicated, with so many moving pieces, that a spokesman for the State Board of Elections could not say Tuesday when it might be resolved. It comes amid four years of pitched ideological battles in a state sharply split between Democrats and Republicans.But it also comes amid a broader wave of skepticism about the integrity of the basic mechanics of the American electoral process, including the recount of the presidential results in three states sought by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. The move enraged President-elect Donald J. Trump, who this week said on Twitter that “millions” of people had illegally voted for Hillary Clinton, a widely derided claim for which he offered no evidence.For some voters here, it can all feel like a failing of a divided nation, and a divided state. The Rev. Phillip Fackler, an Episcopal chaplain, said that it was difficult these days for liberals and conservatives to sit down and work out their differences.“Maybe it’s easier to say, ‘Something was amiss,’” Mr. Fackler, 36, said on Monday as he and hundreds of anti-McCrory protesters waited for the start of the rally at the Capitol.According to a preliminary tally by the State Board of Elections, Mr. Cooper was leading Mr. McCrory by 9,813 votes as of Tuesday night — perilously close to the 10,000-vote difference that would prohibit Mr. McCrory from demanding a recount. Mr. Cooper’s lead has been growing since the Nov. 8 election, as thousands of provisional votes from around the state have been verified.But nine of the state’s 100 counties had still not completed certifying their vote totals as of Tuesday night, in part because of challenges filed by Mr. McCrory’s supporters in dozens of counties, said a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, Patrick Gannon.A number of those challenges charge that the names of some voters belonged to people who had died or to felons ineligible to vote. With that in mind, Mr. McCrory’s supporters have lashed out at Democrats who have called on the governor to concede.“Why is Roy Cooper so insistent on circumventing the electoral process and counting the votes of dead people and felons?” a McCrory campaign spokesman, Ricky Diaz, said in a statement this month.But Mr. Cooper’s supporters argue that any alleged discrepancies are too few in number to affect the outcome of the election — and that the Republicans’ language is often misleading. Allison Riggs, the senior attorney for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice in Durham, N.C., said that all of the dead voters listed in the challenges were alive when they cast ballots during the early-voting period but died before Election Day. (Such votes are ineligible in North Carolina.)The group also found that many of the people identified as ineligible to vote because of a criminal record were, in fact, eligible.Bob Hall, the executive director of the advocacy group Democracy North Carolina, said that 43 voters were listed in the county-by-county challenges as being ineligible felons. The challenges listed 24 dead voters, he said.On Nov. 20, Mr. Cooper, the state’s attorney general, released a brief video addressing his supporters.“Because of your hard work, we have won this race for governor,” he said. He also said that Mr. McCrory was sowing “confusion and fear” with his postelection speeches.The pro-McCrory forces say they simply want to ensure that the election tally is correct. “Any candidate, even candidates that the Democrats hate, are entitled under the law to see what the count is, and to decide whether they should call for a recount,” Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the state Republican Party, said on Tuesday.Under North Carolina law, the governor appoints the five members of the state elections board, and those members, in turn, appoint the members of the 100 county boards. As a result, Republicans enjoy majorities on all of these boards. Nonetheless, the governor’s team has not fared well with them thus far. Some county boards have already thrown out their challenges.On Monday, the McCrory team suffered a further blow when the state board ruled that the challenged votes could be thrown out by county election officials only if there were enough votes to determine the outcome of a local election.Ford Porter, a spokesman for Mr. Cooper’s campaign, said Tuesday that a number of the remaining challenges appeared unlikely to meet that threshold.“This is a devastating blow to the McCrory campaign and further evidence that there is no path to victory for Governor McCrory,” Mr. Cooper’s campaign manager, Trey Nix, said in a statement.Mr. McCrory has announced his intention to call for a statewide recount. But it seems he would prefer to make a last stand in liberal-dominated Durham County. On election night, just before midnight, a tranche of roughly 90,000 ballots were reported there, tipping the vote count in Mr. Cooper’s favor.To many Republicans watching the results on TV, the sudden reversal of fortune for their nominee came as a shock, especially because their party was handily winning the presidential race in the state, and Senator Richard Burr, a Republican, easily won re-election.Since then, the Durham County board has rejected a protest filed by Thomas Stark, a lawyer and McCrory supporter, who claimed that county officials had engaged in “malfeasance” in counting those ballots because they relied on inaccurate ballot machines.But the state board has agreed to hear an appeal of that ruling on Wednesday afternoon. If the board allows a Durham County recount, and the results are the same as the original count, the McCrory team “will be prepared to withdraw its statewide recount request in the governor’s race,” according to a statement released Saturday.The unsettled governor’s race is only one of many voting-related dramas that have engulfed North Carolina recently. In August, a federal court ruled that the state legislative map was unconstitutional because 28 of the districts drawn by Republicans constituted racial gerrymanders.On Tuesday, the court established a March 15, 2017, deadline for redrawing the map — and ruled that legislators in districts affected by the redrawing stand for re-election next fall. Republican legislators called the ruling a “gross overreach” and vowed to appeal.More delays to a resolution of the governor’s race could be in store because of a federal lawsuit filed by Francis X. De Luca, president of the Civitas Institute, a conservative think tank based in Raleigh.The suit, filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, concerns a state provision that allows residents to register and vote on the same day during an early-voting period.Mr. De Luca argues that such registrations cannot be verified until after the state board certifies the election results, so he has asked the court to order the state board not to include those votes in its final tally until the registrations can be verified.A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 8.
