AT&T is finally saying goodbye to Cingular for good.Today  AT&T enters the final phase of one of the biggest rebranding campaigns in marketing history as it officially changes the name of its chain of retail stores from Cingular to AT&T.The process began late last year when AT&T acquired the 40 percent of Cingular it did not already own, through its acquisition of Bell South.Wendy Clark, AT&T’s vice president for advertising, said the company’s market research since then showed that consumers increasingly think of  AT&T as a  wireless provider and that they are generally aware of the transition from Cingular to AT&T.“Our branding campaign is performing above projected levels, we are ahead of schedule and customer response has been very positive,” said Randall Stephenson,  chief operating officer of AT&T.For Cingular, taking the AT&T name brings it full circle. The change comes just three years after Cingular acquired AT&T’s cellular unit, then called AT&T Wireless, and subsequently dropped the AT&T name.AT&T executives are hoping a single brand name will help persuade  customers that the company is a one-stop shop for all kinds of communications and entertainment services, including long-distance and local phone service, wireless, television and high-speed Internet. The new campaign includes print and television ads that focus on this all-in-one message.Also as part of this push, the company recently opened a 5,000-square-foot AT&T Experience megastore in Houston and plans to open similar stores in Atlanta and San Antonio  this year.AT&T executives would not say how much the rebranding campaign would cost. The campaign over the last few years to promote AT&T as the new name of SBC Communications, which was more regional in scope than the current one, cost the company an estimated $1 billion.The final phase of the rebranding comes just in time for AT&T to begin selling the Apple iPhone next month. Apple and Cingular announced in January that Cingular would be the only carrier to provide service for the iPhone, and since then the companies have received more than a million inquiries about the phone, Ms. Clark said.“The excitement around the iPhone launch is like nothing any of us have witnessed before,” she said.Some analysts and branding specialists believe the transition from Cingular to AT&T would not be easy given the popularity of the Cingular brand among younger consumers. AT&T, whose initials hark back to the days of  the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, is burdened by an image as a stodgy institution that has been around for generations, some analysts say.But Ms. Clark says the company’s executives are confident that younger consumers will flock to AT&T given the breadth and sophistication of its offerings. “We believe that AT&T is contemporary and progressive,” she  said.
