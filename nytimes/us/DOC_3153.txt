TOKYO — Nintendo said on Wednesday that poor sales of the Wii U game console had caused a big drop in revenue in the first nine months of its financial year, adding pressure on the company to execute a strategic turnaround.Nintendo has resisted the advance of the smartphone, an increasingly popular platform for video game players, refusing to license popular games like the Mario franchise for mobile use. Instead, it has stuck to console systems, seeking to integrate its own hardware with video game software.But that is a shrinking business, and Nintendo is losing ground to two bigger rivals, Microsoft and Sony, which released new versions of their game consoles late last year.Nintendo, which is based in Kyoto, Japan, said revenue in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, or through December, fell to 499 billion yen, or $4.83 billion, from ¥543 billion a year earlier.Nintendo’s president and other executives said they would take a pay cut for five months to take responsibility for the poor performance. The pay of the president, Satoru Iwata, will be cut in half.Nintendo warned two weeks ago that it expected to sell only 2.8 million Wii U consoles for the full fiscal year, compared with previous forecasts for nine million. Nintendo said on Wednesday that it had sold 2.41 million Wii U consoles in the first three quarters, and the company added that it was taking an additional hit from price cuts.“The Wii U hardware still has a negative impact on Nintendo’s profits, owing mainly to its markdown in the United States and Europe, and sales of software, which has high profit margins, did not grow sufficiently,” the company said in a news release.Sales of the Nintendo 3DS, a portable game device, have done better, but are also below previous forecasts.The company has announced plans to disclose a new management strategy on Thursday in a briefing to investors by Mr. Iwata.While some analysts say Nintendo could reap a bonanza by making its games available for mobile use, it gave no indication on Wednesday that such a move was imminent. Indeed, it issued a statement this week denying a report in the newspaper Nihon Keizai that it planned to offer so-called minigames, based on Nintendo franchises, for smartphones.Although revenue fell steeply in the first three quarters of the year, Nintendo said it was helped by the decline of the yen, which lifted the value of overseas sales when converted into the Japanese currency.Net income in the first three quarters fell to ¥10.2 billion from ¥14.5 billion.
