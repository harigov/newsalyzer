Whether your game is golf, soccer, snow biking or Ping-Pong, 2016 is shaping up to be a flag-waving year among fans.Any Olympic year is a great one for sports spectators, and this summer’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro (Aug. 5 to 21) offers quadrennial opportunities for indulging in low-profile events like archery, equestrian jumping, table tennis and badminton in addition to the big-ticket competitions including gymnastics, swimming and track and field in one of the world’s most stunning cities. Rio’s bid for the 2016 Games included a vow to clean up the city’s surrounding waters, which remain filthy according to a recent Associated Press test. Still, organizers are soldiering on, recently unveiling their centerpiece Barra Olympic Park with an exhibition in its new Olympic Tennis Center and a new golf course where medals will be awarded in Olympic golf for the first time since 1904.Rio’s games aren’t the only international contest on the 2016 calendar. The biennial Arctic Winter Games (March 6 to 11) will draw biathlon snowshoers, hockey players, skiers and general fans of snow play to Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. The meet, designed for youth athletes from Arctic regions, includes competition in Arctic sports, Inuit games such as the two-foot-high kick in which competitors jump to reach a dangling target with their feet; and Dene games, from the aboriginal inhabitants of northern Canada, including the pole push, a sort of tug of war with a pole rather than a rope.Golf uniquely pivots from an individual sport to a team one every other year with the Ryder Cup. Team USA has won only two of the last 10 meets against Team Europe. Captain Davis Love III and vice captains including, for the first time, Tiger Woods, will seek revenge next fall at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis (Sept. 27 to Oct. 2)Despite domestic scandals, Deflategate charges of cheating and concussions on the field and on the movie screen, pro football remains the nation’s most popular sport. Having scrapped its Roman numerals on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the N.F.L. will take Super Bowl 50 (Feb. 7) to the San Francisco 49ers’ new Levi’s Stadium in suburban Santa Clara. A fan village with games and entertainment will open Jan. 30. For a fan-friendly preview of the league’s future, the N.F.L. Draft will return to Chicago (April 28 to 30) in a festival-like setting in Grant Park downtown, only the second time the event has been held outside New York.The growing legions of soccer fans drawn by last summer’s Women’s World Cup win by the United States women’s national team will find an international import to cheer next summer. Featuring 16 national men’s teams from the Americas and the Caribbean, the Copa America Centenario will be staged stateside for the first time (June 3 to 26). Ten American cities will host Group Stage matches, including Orlando, Fla.; Pasadena, Calif.; Philadelphia; and Seattle, with semifinals in Chicago and Houston, and the finals at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.Snow biking has been cranking up at ski resorts — and even urban areas — for the past several years. In 2016, the sport will get its first major international meet in the Fat Bike World Championships in Crested Butte, Colo. (Jan. 27 to 31), featuring elite races and others open to amateurs.Also inviting amateurs, but in polar-opposite climes, PADI Women’s Dive Day, sponsored by the scuba dive industry’s Professional Association of Diving Instructors, will be reprised July 16 with hundreds of dive events in 65 countries. Last year’s inaugural event featured participants in mermaid fins in New Zealand and Mary Poppins attire in France.
