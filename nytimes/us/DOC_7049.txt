HONG KONG, Friday, Oct. 20 — When helicopter-borne Australian commandos stormed a freighter three years ago after it was spotted unloading 110 pounds of high-grade heroin, the ship proved to be registered in Tuvalu, a tiny island nation in the South Pacific.When a Spanish warship stopped a freighter carrying cement to Yemen four years ago, the cargo vessel turned out to be carrying 15 Scud missiles as well and was registered in Cambodia.The two freighters had something in common: although registered elsewhere, both were owned by North Korea.The incidents illustrated North Korea’s adroit use of so-called flags of convenience to camouflage the movement of its cargo vessels as they engage in tasks that sometimes violate international laws.The North Korean ploy could both simplify and complicate the efforts to carry out the United Nations Security Council’s resolution authorizing countries to inspect cargo entering or leaving North Korea to see if it includes illicit weapons, say shipping executives, lawyers and security experts.The use of flags of convenience could also weaken moves like Australia’s on Monday to ban North Korean-flagged vessels from its ports to protest the nuclear test.But if Western nations suspect that a North Korean-owned vessel flying another country’s flag is carrying illicit weapons, boarding the vessel could be simpler than if it carried North Korea’s flag, said Jonathan D. Pollack, professor of Asian and Pacific studies at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.A Western nation could ask the country that registered the vessel for permission to board it even if the vessel was  not entering or leaving North Korean waters. Practically any country would be more cooperative about giving permission for a search than North Korea, Mr. Pollack noted.A North Korean crew might still resist boarding, however. The crew of the Tuvalu-registered freighter, the Pong Su, did so when chased by Australian forces for four days in 2003 before it was finally boarded and captured by the commandos.But Mr. Pollack and other experts said that flags of convenience could still prove useful to North Korea in maintaining its arms trade despite the Security Council resolution.One possibility would be for North Korea to try to smuggle out weapons or weapons components across its land borders with China or Russia, and then to a Chinese or Russian port. The weapons could then be loaded on a vessel secretly owned by North Korea but flying another country’s flag — and perhaps not be closely watched by Western intelligence services as a result.Or weapons could be loaded on a North Korean ship flying its own flag, and the registration of the ship could be altered after it left port. “In the middle of the night, they could change the name and change the flag,” said Gary Wolfe, a maritime lawyer at Seward & Kissel,  a New York law firm.Still another possibility, shipping and security experts said, would be for a North Korean-flagged ship to transfer cargo to a North Korean ship carrying another flag, either in port or in midocean if it were a calm day and the cargo small enough.Changing the registration of a ship — and therefore its flag — is fairly simple. A ship owner simply sends the necessary paperwork to a country’s ship registry, along with a fee of as little as $1,000. The vessel is not required to visit the country where it is registered, or even go to port.Ship registries do require basic information about a vessel’s length and  tonnage. So if a ship of a certain size and displacement disappears from one ship’s registry and a vessel of equal size and displacement pops up with a different name on another registry at the same time, they may be the same ship and could be identified with careful sleuthing, Mr. Wolfe said.The Pong Su sailed from North Korea to Singapore in 2003 under a North Korean flag. The vessel then switched its registration to Tuvalu and sailed on to Australia, where witnesses saw a dinghy coming ashore with what proved to be the shipment of heroin.The freighter was seized and later used as a bombing target by the Australian armed forces as a warning to drug traffickers. The North Korean government denied that it had been involved.Without specifically mentioning flags of convenience, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned on Wednesday of the difficulty of monitoring North Korea’s trade. “There’s so much moving around the world by land, sea and air that it is practically impossible — not impossible, but certainly it would take a lot of countries cooperating with a high degree of cohesion,” and cohesion has been lacking, he said during a question-and-answer period at Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Alabama.Until 2002, North Korea tended to register its ships as Cambodian, using a registration office that the Cambodian government had authorized in Singapore. Marcus Hand, the Asia editor for Lloyd’s List, a shipping industry newspaper, said dozens of North Korean ships used to carry the Cambodian flag.He cautioned, however, that it is often difficult to know with certainty who owns a ship, since ships are often held through various companies registered all over the world. No one outside North Korea really knows for sure how many cargo vessels the country has registered under other flags.Cambodia canceled the right of its Singapore agents to register ships in 2002 after finding that Cambodian-registered ships were in such poor condition that ports were reluctant to let them berth, and after France accused a Cambodian-registered ship and its crew of transporting cocaine. The government of Cambodia ended up authorizing representatives in Pusan, South Korea, to manage the country’s ship registry.Charlie Bach, the managing director of the overhauled International Ship Registry of Cambodia, said in an e-mail message that there were no longer any North Korean ships carrying the Cambodian flag.The mystery lies in where North Korea’s ships are registered instead.Several shipping executives said  they believed that North Korean ships were sailing under Mongolian and Tuvaluan flags now.The Tuvalu ship registry said Friday  in an e-mail statement that it had been reorganized in May 2004 and had no vessels previously on North Korean or Cambodian registries.
