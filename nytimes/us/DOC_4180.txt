Just try to keep up with the flurry of images in Daniel Kaufman’s “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop,” a whirl through the history of Sean Combs and Bad Boy, the entertainment company he founded and that often dominated hip-hop and R&B in the 1990s and 2000s. Mr. Combs, who topped Forbes’s 2017 list of highest-paid celebrities, is a mogul in television, clothing, fragrances and spirits. “Can’t Stop” sticks with the music, focusing on preparations for two Bad Boy reunion concerts in May 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.After glimpsing visitors and performers backstage — including Jay-Z, Faith Evans and Lil’ Kim — we learn of Mr. Combs’s beginnings at Uptown Records, before his ascent with a string of platinum Bad Boy albums. Much time is devoted to Biggie Smalls and his 1997 killing in a drive-by shooting amid the coastal rap rivalry that also claimed Tupac Shakur. (“Puff was Big’s big brother,” Jay-Z says, invoking one of Mr. Combs’s nicknames.) On camera, Clive Davis, Jimmy Iovine, Mary J. Blige and others testify to Mr. Combs’s gifts. (Mr. Combs, of course, produced the film, with Heather Parry.)After rehearsals in Lititz, Pa., the players hit Barclays, where an audio glitch dampens Mr. Combs’s entrance on a riser. On the film’s soundtrack, Nina Simone’s “I Feel Good” accompanies a glossy montage of stage footage, but the artists performing at the concert aren’t heard until the closing credits, and only briefly. What “Can’t Stop” mostly leaves you with is a sense of Mr. Combs’s success.
