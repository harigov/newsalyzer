WASHINGTON —  President Obama will travel to Roseburg, Ore., on Friday to meet privately with the families of the people shot at a community college last week, the White House announced Monday.Mr. Obama was visibly angry in public comments after the shooting, denouncing opponents of gun safety legislation and urging Americans to make decisions on whom to vote for based on whether candidates support what he called reasonable measures to control access to firearms.“This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” Mr. Obama lamented at the White House. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”On Friday, Mr. Obama will once again seek to become the nation’s consoler in chief as he travels to a community racked with grief over a mass shooting. The White House did not provide details of Mr. Obama’s plans while he is in Roseburg.Mr. Obama was already scheduled to be on the West Coast for a four-day trip that includes political fund-raisers in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as some downtime in Southern California. He is expected to return to Washington at the beginning of next week.
