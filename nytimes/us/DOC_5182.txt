MEXICO CITY — Amid the diplomatic showdown over President Trump’s order to build a border wall — and who should pay for it — Mr. Trump and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico spoke by telephone for an hour on Friday and agreed to proceed with negotiations on a range of bilateral issues, both leaders said.The presidents made an effort to say that the call had been productive, implying that tensions had cooled, but they stood their ground on their positions, with no suggestion that the conversation had resolved their disagreement over fundamental issues, most notably the payment for construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.“With respect to payment for the border wall, both presidents recognized their clear and very public differences in their stances on this very sensitive issue, and agreed to solve these differences as part of a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of the bilateral relationship,” according to a statement issued by Mr. Peña Nieto’s office.The statement added: “The presidents also agreed for now not to speak publicly about this controversial issue.”The White House issued an almost identical statement, calling it “a joint statement.” But it differed in one key respect: It did not include any mention of an agreement to refrain from speaking publicly about the wall or its financing.The standoff with Mexico’s president was the first full-blown foreign policy clash with a foreign leader of the Trump administration, and was the culmination of months of tension between the two men surrounding Mr. Trump’s pledge to build the wall and renegotiate Nafta, the trade accord.The rancor came to a head this week after Mr. Trump issued an executive order for construction of the border wall. On Thursday, Mr. Peña Nieto, who has long urged diplomacy in the face of Mr. Trump’s disparaging comments about Mexico, canceled a meeting with the new American leader that had been scheduled for Tuesday.“We had a very good call,” Mr. Trump said Friday at a news conference in Washington. “The border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I’m not going to let that happen.”“I have great respect for Mexico,” he continued. “I love the Mexican people.” But he added that Mexico “has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders.”“They’ve made us look foolish,” he added.Neither side disclosed who had initiated the phone conversation.Mr. Peña Nieto did not comment beyond the statement issued by his office. But a Mexican government official described the conversation as “cordial” and said it went “relatively well.”The presidents did not set another date to meet, in part to allow the relationship to “cool off,” said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss a diplomatic issue.But they agreed to allow their teams to push forward with negotiations on an array of bilateral issues, including trade, immigration and the cross-border trafficking of drugs and weapons, the official said.They also agreed to leave discussion about the wall and its funding out of the negotiations, in effect quarantining it so that it did not contaminate conversations about other issues, the official said.Mr. Peña Nieto was widely applauded in Mexico for canceling the meeting — a rare moment of public approval for a wildly unpopular leader.He received additional backing on Friday from Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, who held a rare news conference to criticize Mr. Trump and publicly throw his support behind the Mexican government as it entered what he called “arduous, difficult” negotiations with the United States, specifically referring to Nafta.“We have to support the president of Mexico to defend the national interest,” Mr. Slim told a packed news conference at his business headquarters in Mexico City.Mr. Slim said “there are those” who “apparently don’t have pluralism, diversity, liberty, human rights, globalization, productivity, the environment, competition, on their radar,” in a clear reference to Mr. Trump, whom he dined with in Palm Beach last month.The White House team, he continued, is “negotiating from a position of strength to see if we weaken.” Like a growing number of Mexican business leaders and policy makers, Mr. Slim said that Mexico should be prepared to allow the United States to withdraw from Nafta if the Americans’ demands were too high.But he said that Mexican negotiators must try to convince the Americans that “it’s better to do more business with us.”The relationship between Presidents Peña Nieto and Trump — not to mention Mr. Trump’s with the rest of Mexico — had been on a downward trajectory since Mr. Trump took aim at Mexican immigrants during the 2015 speech that kicked off his campaign, and proceeded to build his White House run on promises to build a border wall, deport millions of Mexicans and pull out of Nafta.On Monday, in advance of the meeting between the presidents that had been scheduled for next week, Mr. Peña Nieto released a set of principles that he said would guide any negotiations between the two countries. “Mexico doesn’t believe in walls,” he said.The next day, however, Mr. Trump issued a Twitter message reaffirming his vow to build the wall, to which the Mexican president, responding in a televised speech distributed on social media, once again criticized the project and reiterated his longstanding vow that Mexico would never pay for it.But on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump seemed to escalate the matter further with a threat to cancel the meeting should Mexico not be willing to pay for the wall, immediately prompting Mr. Peña Nieto’s cancellation of the meeting, a gambit that was widely applauded here by a population that has been clamoring for him to take a forcible stand against Mr. Trump’s provocations.Mr. Slim, in his rambling 90-minute news conference, extolled the national unity he witnessed this week as Mexicans overwhelmingly rejected Mr. Trump’s treatment of Mexico.“This national unity is very important to allow the government to go with dignity and strength to negotiate,” he said.
