WASHINGTON —  Nearly nine million people gained health insurance last year, lowering the ranks of the uninsured to 10.4 percent of the population. But there was no statistically significant change in income for the typical American household in 2014, the Obama administration said on Wednesday.Median household income in the United States was $53,660 last year, the Census Bureau reported, and the poverty rate — 14.8 percent — also saw no improvement. About 46.7 million people were in poverty in 2014, the bureau said, the fourth consecutive year in which the number of people in poverty was not statistically different from the official estimate for the prior year.Overall, the new census numbers suggest that one major government program, to provide health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, is working, but that for ordinary Americans, especially the poor, the economic recovery — now into its seventh year — has yet to deliver measurable benefits.“Despite decent employment growth in 2014, the persistent high unemployment yielded no improvements in wages and no improvement in the median incomes of working-age households or any reduction in poverty,” said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group influential with Democrats in Congress.“Anyone wondering why people in this country are feeling so ornery need look no further than this report,” Mr. Mishel continued. “Wages have been broadly stagnant for a dozen years, and median household income peaked in 1999.”Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the new numbers showed that Congress should revamp antipoverty programs.“Rather than just treating the symptoms of poverty, our goal must be to help people move from welfare into work and self-sufficiency,” Mr. Ryan saidIn its annual report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage, the Census Bureau said that the percentage of people without insurance was 10.4 percent last year, down from 13.3 percent in 2013.The fraction of the population without health insurance decreased last year in every state, the bureau said.Much of the change was attributable to the Affordable Care Act, officials said, but the Census Bureau could not say exactly how much.In the last two years, the Obama administration has issued a steady stream of upbeat reports showing a big expansion of coverage and a sharp reduction in the number of uninsured.To support its claims, the administration has cited estimates by the Urban Institute, the RAND Corporation, the Gallup organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others.None of those estimates, however, are as reliable or authoritative as the census data, which showed increases in both private and government coverage.From 2013 to 2014, the bureau said, the overall rate of insurance coverage increased for all racial groups and for Hispanics, who may be of any race.The increases were comparable for blacks, Asians and Hispanics (just over 4 percentage points) and lower for non-Hispanic whites (about 2 percentage points).The lack of any significant change in median household income, after adjustment for inflation, was somewhat surprising to experts, who had expected to see some modest growth in income because of improvements in the economy last year.Edward J. Welniak Jr., a Census Bureau statistician, said the income findings may reflect the fact that there were more “nonfamily households” in 2014.These households — single people living alone or with roommates, and unmarried couples — “typically have much lower incomes than family households,” Mr. Welniak said.Many households have still not regained the purchasing power they had before the recession that began in December 2007. Median household income was 6.5 percent lower in 2014 than in 2007, the bureau said. The number of households with income above the median is the same as the number below it.The report included these findings:■ About 10 percent of households had incomes above $157,480 last year, while 5 percent had incomes above $206,570. At the other end of the spectrum, 10 percent of households had incomes less than $12,280.■ The pay gap between men and women has changed little in recent years. Among full-time year-round workers, median earnings for women were 79 percent of those for men last year, compared with 78 percent in 2007. By contrast, in 1964, the ratio was 59 percent.None of the major racial and ethnic groups experienced a statistically significant change in their poverty rates or in the number of people in poverty.The poverty rate for blacks (26 percent) is about two and half times that for non-Hispanic whites (10 percent).A family of four was classified as poor if its income was less than $24,230 last year. For one person, the threshold was $12,070.The biggest gains in health insurance coverage occurred last year among households with incomes less than $50,000 a year. For households with incomes of $100,000 or more, the gains were small.The extremes of coverage, as often in recent years, were found in Massachusetts, where 3.3 percent of the people are uninsured, and Texas, where 19 percent lack coverage.In Vermont, Hawaii and Minnesota, small shares of the population are uninsured.The reverse is true in Alaska, Florida and Georgia. Florida significantly expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but 16.6 percent of Floridians were still uninsured last year, the bureau reported.
