Nostalgic gaming fans can stop digging through their attics. Nintendo surprised traditionalists on Thursday with a new way to defeat Dr. Wily, Mother Brain and Bowser.The company announced that a mini-replica of its original NES console, first released in 1985, will be available on Nov. 11, preloaded with 30 of its most recognizable games and priced at $59.99.Called the NES Classic Edition, it will fit in a single hand and come with an HDMI cable and AC adapter to plug into modern TVs, plus one classic controller. Extra controllers will cost $9.99 apiece.The list of games features several of Nintendo’s biggest hits, including the first three Super Mario Bros. games, the first two Zelda games, Mega Man 2, Metroid and Excitebike.“We wanted to give fans of all ages the opportunity to revisit Nintendo’s original system and rediscover why they fell in love with Nintendo in the first place,” Reggie Fils-Aime, president of Nintendo of America, said in a statement.Nintendo is hoping to tap into the nostalgia that helped propel the Pokémon Go app into a gaming behemoth in just days, even surpassing usage numbers for Twitter, according to SimilarWeb, a tracking firm.Though Nintendo didn’t create the mobile game — it’s the work of Niantic Inc., a start-up spun out of Google last year — the Pokémon franchise is partly owned by Nintendo and appeals to roughly the same generation that grew up playing the NES.While the proliferation of smartphones has made gaming explode on mobile devices, Nintendo steadfastly stuck to its focus on hardware until last year, when it announced a partnership with the Japanese mobile gaming company DeNA. The two companies released Miitomo in March, and plan to release two more this year: “Animal Crossing” and “Fire Emblem.”Its consoles have not fared so well recently. The most recent one, Wii U, has had disappointing sales, lagging behind its rivals, Microsoft’s Xbox One and Sony’s PlayStation 4. Nintendo plans to unveil its next console, code-named NX, in 2017.Oh, and that habit you had of blowing on the NES cartridges to make them work? That never actually helped.
