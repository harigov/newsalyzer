A parole panel on Thursday recommended parole to a former Charles Manson follower, Leslie Van Houten, more than four decades after she went to prison. The decision, on her 20th parole hearing, is subject to an administrative review by the board. If upheld it goes to Gov. Jerry Brown, who has the final word on whether Ms. Van Houten, 66, will be released. Ms. Van Houten participated in the killings of Leno La Bianca and his wife, Rosemary, a day after other so-called Manson family members murdered the pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others in 1969. (AP)Tony Spence, the director and editor in chief of the Catholic News Service since 2004, was forced to resign on Wednesday by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops after he made posts on Twitter  castigating religious freedom laws as “pro-discrimination” laws against gay people. The bishops’ conference acted after several conservative Roman Catholic groups posted articles calling attention to the comments. The Catholic News Service is owned by the bishops’ conference, but it functions like a relatively independent wire service, with coverage of church affairs in the United States and in Rome. Mr. Spence, who has worked in church communications for 25 years, said that he was a “casualty” of “the culture wars.” The news of his resignation was first reported by National Catholic Reporter.LAURIE GOODSTEIN
