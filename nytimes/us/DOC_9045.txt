Lynne B. Sagalyn’s “Power at Ground Zero: Politics, Money and the Remaking of Lower Manhattan” and Judith Dupré’s “One World Trade Center: Biography of the Building” are two of the most consequential new books about the redevelopment of the World Trade Center.Here is a list of nine other books to which I have turned again and again during the 13 years I’ve covered the story. There are equally good books on the long Sept. 11 shelf, but these are the most thumbed-through in my collection. They may offer a helpful starting point for anyone studying the history of the site.“Aftermath: World Trade Center Archive,” by Joel Meyerowitz.“City in the Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center,” by James Glanz and Eric Lipton.“Imagining Ground Zero: Official and Unofficial Proposals for the World Trade Center Site,” by Suzanne Stephens, with Ian Luna and Ron Broadhurst.“102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers,” by Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn.“Sixteen Acres: Architecture and the Outrageous Struggle for the Future of Ground Zero,” by Philip Nobel.“Starting From Zero: Reconstructing Downtown New York,” by Michael Sorkin.“Twin Towers: The Life of New York City’s World Trade Center,” by Angus Kress Gillespie. (Updated.)“Up From Zero: Politics, Architecture and the Rebuilding of New York,” by Paul Goldberger.“The World Trade Center: Classics of American Architecture,” by Anthony W. Robins. (Updated.)
