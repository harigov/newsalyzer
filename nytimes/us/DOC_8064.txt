Federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents investigating Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign fund-raising questioned Mr. de Blasio for four hours Friday as part of a criminal inquiry into whether he or other officials traded beneficial city action for political donations.The interview, at the Midtown Manhattan offices of the mayor’s lawyers, focused on various topics that have come under scrutiny in the nearly yearlong inquiry, people with knowledge of the matter said.The mayor and several staff members arrived for the session in two large black sport utility vehicles around 9 a.m., driving into a garage beneath the building without speaking to waiting reporters. They left the same way.In a statement, the mayor’s press secretary, Eric Phillips, cited what he called Mr. de Blasio’s cooperation in the inquiry. “We remain confident that at all times the mayor and his staff acted appropriately and well within the law,” the statement said. “We hope our continued cooperation will help bring a swift conclusion to the U.S. attorney’s review.”About a half-dozen prosecutors and several F.B.I. agents were present, a person with knowledge of the session said. The mayor was joined by his lawyers, Barry H. Berke and Dani R. James of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, and one of their associates.The prosecutors, from the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, included Mr. Bharara’s deputy, Joon H. Kim, and the chief and deputy chief of the office’s Public Corruption Unit. The F.B.I. agents, the person said, included the chief of the Public Corruption Squad handling the case.
