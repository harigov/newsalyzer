Midsummer nights bring free Shakespeare in Central Park, and two productions are under way. The Boomerang Theater Company is staging “All’s Well That Ends Well” on Saturdays and Sundays through July 22 near 69th Street, and the Public Theater’s “Romeo and Juliet” is running nightly through July 8 at the Delacorte Theater, near the Central Park West entrance at 81st Street.If you’re looking for a bite beforehand, try these restaurants.EARTHEN OVEN(212) 579-8888; 53 West 72nd Street (Columbus Avenue); $; $25 and Under: 2/21/07.The tandoor, the top-loading oven from which a whole subcuisine of Indian food springs, gets superhot: At Earthen Oven, Durga Prasad’s tandoor reaches 700 degrees. The lamb chops masaledar luxuriate in a bath of yogurt, garlic, ginger, ground cashews and spices for more than a day before they are skewered and plunged into the tandoor. Order them medium rare and marvel at the precision.FUNKY DINER(212) 873-0600; 466 Columbus Avenue (82nd Street); $; Article: 1/17/07.A selection of creamy gelati greets customers at this new spot, where the specialties are classic American diner food and European street food like sweet and savory crepes. The menu offers burgers, eggs, potatoes, sandwiches, waffles, soda fountain drinks, fancy cheeses, imported beer and wine.GARI ★★(212) 362-4816; 370 Columbus Avenue (78th Street); $$$$; Review: 3/2/05. Gari’s calling card is sushi that has been tweaked slightly or gussied up significantly, but this restaurant usually doesn’t let the process get out of hand. Gari does right by sushi rice, serving it warm, so that the temperature of the fish atop it is raised.Gari also has ostensibly Japanese-inspired dishes, and some of this cooked food is as impressive as the uncooked fish.SHEEP MEADOW CAFE(212) 396-4100; near West 67th Street in Central Park; $$; Article: 6/7/06. Charcoal grilling is a specialty at this seasonal restaurant, in an old snack bar on the edge of the Sheep Meadow. The cafe has seating for 200, all outdoors, with a lunch and dinner menu that includes grilled sirloin steak, breast of duck, rosemary chicken, salmon, trout, and clams or mussels.TELEPAN ★★(212) 580-4300; 72 West 69th Street (Columbus Avenue); $$$; Review: 2/15/06.The chef Bill Telepan’s approach to food isn’t the kind that provokes wild-eyed ardor (or, for that matter, eye-rolling exasperation). But it does engender deep affection and admiration.The seasonal New American menu currently has soft shell crabs with bacon, spinach, radish and balsamic red onion; and heritage pork four ways with mashed peas and organic grits.
