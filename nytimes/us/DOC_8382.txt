When it became clear on Thursday that Democrats in the United States House of Representatives could not defeat a bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, they turned to a time-honored American tradition: taunting the other side.“Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye,” dozens of Democrats sang in unison as the health care bill crossed the 216 votes needed to pass.What they lacked in originality — the No. 1 song from 1969 by the group Steam is a standard anthem at sporting events — the Democrats made up for in enthusiasm. Their voices echoed throughout the House chamber, loud enough to be heard on a live feed on C-Span and even overpowering some celebrations by Republicans.Before the vote on Thursday, Democrats warned Republicans that they would pay a steep price in future elections if they followed through with plans to drastically change parts of the health law. “House Republicans are going to tattoo this moral monstrosity to their foreheads, and the American people will hold them accountable,” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday.The brief chant on Thursday underscored the hostility and disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over the health bill. But it was not exactly novel.When former President Barack Obama boarded his helicopter to leave Washington after President Trump’s inauguration in January, some enthusiastic Trump supporters belted, “Na, na, na, hey, hey, goodbye.” That moment echoed a nearly identical scene on Jan. 20, 2009, as former President George W. Bush’s helicopter ushered him away from the Capitol and into retirement.Even in Congress, the anthem has been chanted going back at least a quarter century, including in 1993 when Republicans sang the chorus after Democrats voted to raise taxes under President Bill Clinton.The song, by Paul Leka and Gary DeCarlo, “Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye),” had commercial success in the late 1960s but became a go-to, crowd-roaring taunt in 1977. That is when the organist for the Chicago White Sox started to play the anthem when opposing players struck out or when their pitchers were replaced.
