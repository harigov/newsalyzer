NEW DELHI — Nestlé’s unit in India said on Friday that it would withdraw its popular Maggi brand of instant noodles from stores across the nation, after mounting concerns over reports that some samples contained high levels of lead.“Trust has been shaken and therefore it is not conducive to have our product on the shelf, we felt, in spite of the product being safe,” Nestle’s chief executive, Paul Bulcke, said on Friday at a news conference in New Delhi.After Nestlé’s announcement Friday, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ordered a recall, saying all nine variants of the noodles were “unsafe and hazardous for human consumption.”At least five more states in India had banned the sale of the noodles on Thursday. Gujarat, one of those states, initiated a monthlong ban of the product, after samples tested positive for higher than permissible levels of lead.The government in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir also issued a monthlong ban on the sale of Maggi noodles pending tests on samples, though a state official said that the ban would be lifted if the noodles are found to be safe.Uttarakhand issued a ban on the sale of Maggi for three months, after it found two samples of the noodles contained monosodium glutamate, commonly known as MSG, without listing the ingredient, according to the health secretary, Om Prakash. He said that the state was conducting tests on 300 samples of the noodles, and should they be found safe, the ban would be lifted. The state of Assam also banned the sale of Maggi noodles over concerns about the safety of the product.Tamil Nadu issued a three-month ban on the sale, storage and manufacturing of Maggi and three other brands of noodles, according to The Press Trust of India.The Nepal government also banned the sale and import of the noodles, according to Purna Chandra Wasti, a spokesman for the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, who added that the department had been collecting samples for testing on Thursday.Mr. Bulcke said that because of the confusion over MSG, which he said could have come from naturally occurring glutamate from various ingredients, the company would also remove the “No Added MSG” label from packages.At least three states have said that they have not found tested Maggi samples unsafe, according to The Press Trust of India, and the company has conducted external and internal tests on almost 1,600 samples of the product, finding lead levels to be “well within the limits specified by food regulations,” the company said.Maggi’s ubiquity in Indian markets is a reflection of its appeal as a quick-cooking solution for busy Indians. Three Bollywood actors who have endorsed the product in the past have been the target of a court case in the Indian state of Bihar for their endorsement after a consumer became ill.“India is important to us and that’s why I am here,” Mr. Bulcke said on Friday. He said that Nestlé had been in India for 100 years.The public outcry over the noodles, which are widely sold and consumed in India, has picked up since the authorities in Uttar Pradesh last month revealed that they had found lead in samples tested at nearly seven times the permissible limits. The authorities in the state have initiated a case against the company. The Delhi government issued a 15-day ban on the product on Wednesday after preliminary test results revealed higher than permissible levels of lead in samples, and the presence of MSG without proper labeling.
