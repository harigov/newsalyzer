La MaMa will begin its next season in a state of transition: Its original theater is undergoing renovation, and will not host any shows for the first time in 55 years. But in its new spaces, the avant-garde theater’s lineup will be as diverse and politically fiery as always, with highlights including a Tennessee Williams adaptation and a visit from the Belarus Free Theater.That troupe, which has been banned from its homeland for its politically charged works, has performed at La MaMa over the years. This time it will present the New York premiere of “Burning Doors,” which features Maria Alyokhina of Pussy Riot. Ms. Alyokhina and other band members were imprisoned for protest performances in Russia, and this production (Oct. 13-22) will dramatize her story, as well as those of other persecuted artists.On Nov. 2-19, La MaMa will celebrate Charles Ludlam, an absurdist actor, playwright and director who died of AIDS 30 years ago, and who staged many of his works at La MaMa. His 1967 play, “Conquest of the Universe, or When Queens Collide,” will receive a full revival, with Everett Quinton — a longtime member of Mr. Ludlam’s Ridiculous Theatrical Company — directing.A production of Tennessee Williams’s “Kingdom of Earth” will run Oct. 4-8, with direction from Fred Abrahamse. And the dance series La MaMa Moves! will return in May, with an emphasis on emerging gay and transgender choreographers of color.All performances will take place a couple of doors down from the original theater, at La MaMa’s new hub at 74 East Fourth Street, which includes three performance spaces. Renovations of the original theater are expected to be complete by the fall of 2019. A full lineup can be found at lamama.org.
