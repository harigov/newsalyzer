There are no precise statistics on illegal immigrants. For this article, The New York Times estimated the number of illegal immigrants who drive by analyzing data from the Census Bureau’s 2006-8 American Community Survey, which includes all United States residents regardless of immigration status as well as information  about commuting to work.People in that survey who were likely to be illegal immigrants were identified using a method developed by Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, a research group in Washington. The estimate includes people reported to drive alone and a portion of people in car pools.For figures on unlicensed driving, The Times used the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s database of fatal accidents, a primary source for traffic studies. It provides information on the license status and ethnicity of drivers killed  in the accidents, but not on immigration status.The Times analysis, which included all deadly crashes from 2000 through 2009, found that the Hispanic drivers in those accidents were far more likely to be unlicensed than other drivers, particularly in a cluster of Southern states that have experienced a surge in illegal immigration. However, there is no way of measuring the extent to which these disparities apply to all drivers and not just those involved in crashes. About 80 percent of illegal immigrants are Hispanic, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
