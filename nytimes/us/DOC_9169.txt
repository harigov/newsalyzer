GENEVA — The United Nations Human Rights Council decided on Wednesday to appoint a panel of experts to explore legal avenues for prosecuting North Korean leaders for crimes against humanity.The council, based in Geneva, passed a resolution calling for the appointment of independent experts to identify and recommend “practical mechanisms of accountability” for abuses detailed in a landmark 2014 report of a commission of inquiry.The council adopted the resolution without a vote despite criticism from six countries, including China and Russia.The commission of inquiry recommended that the United Nations Security Council refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court to answer for widespread crimes against humanity, including extrajudicial killings, the enslavement of tens of thousands of detainees in a network of prison camps, torture, rape, and religious and political persecution.Supporters of the resolution recognized the difficulty of obtaining a referral to the criminal court from the Security Council, where China, North Korea’s traditional ally, wields a veto. The resolution is intended to keep up the pressure on North Korea’s leadership by identifying alternative approaches for bringing to justice those responsible for abuses.“We gave them a good chance to demonstrate good will in the last two years,” Marzuki Darusman, the United Nations investigator monitoring human rights developments in North Korea, said after delivering his final report to the Human Rights Council last week. “Now is the time to close in on them.”
