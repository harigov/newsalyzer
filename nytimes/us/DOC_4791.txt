SYDNEY, Australia — The United Nations strongly rebuked Australia over its human rights record after the highest court here ruled on Wednesday against a challenge to Australia’s immigration policies.The High Court decision means 267 asylum seekers could be transferred from Australia to an offshore detention center on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru.Most of the asylum seekers, who were from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iran and Bangladesh, were brought to Australia from Nauru for medical treatment. The group includes 37 babies born here after their mothers were transferred for the births because Nauru lacks adequate medical facilities.It also includes more than 12 women and at least one child who said they had been sexually abused or harassed while on the island.“Australia is at risk of breaching its obligations not to return any person to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment under the Convention Against Torture,” said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.In a statement issued from Geneva, the human rights agency said broader aspects of “Australia’s policy on the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers arriving without prior authorization significantly contravenes the letter and the spirit of international human rights law.”The government refuses to allow asylum seekers to settle on the Australian mainland if they attempt to arrive by boat without prior authorization.Rickety boats carrying asylum seekers have been turned around and towed back out to sea, and the conservative government of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was accused last year of paying smugglers to turn their boat around and return to Indonesia.The Australian government at the time refused to confirm or deny those accusations, which surfaced after Asian migrants told United Nations refugee workers in Indonesia that Australian officials had intercepted their boat at sea and that the boat’s crew had been paid to take them back to Indonesia.The government says turning boats back has discouraged smugglers and halted deaths at sea.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Wednesday that the High Court decision upheld the government’s immigration policies as “legally and constitutionally valid.”Daniel Webb, an advocate at the Human Rights Law Center based in Melbourne, said the legal issues around the High Court case were complex. “But the moral issue is simple,” he said. “It would be fundamentally wrong for the government to condemn these families to a life in limbo on Nauru.”The High Court case, run by the Human Rights Law Center, questioned whether the Australian government had the right to pay the government of Nauru to detain asylum seekers. The case centered on a Bangladeshi woman, held on Nauru but brought to Australia for medical treatment during the late stages of her pregnancy.The United Nations also criticized the government over a decision to retrospectively change Australia’s Migration Act after the case had started to validate the offshore processing of asylum seekers.“We are very concerned about the situation of the 267 people, including up to 80 children, at risk of being transferred from Australia to Nauru following the High Court’s decision,” the statement said.Last March, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, found that Australia’s policies, including the detention of children, breached an anti-torture convention. Responding to that criticism, Mr. Abbott, then prime minister, said Australians were tired of being lectured by the United Nations.Mr. Abbott was replaced by Malcolm Turnbull in September.Offshore detention and the processing of asylum seekers under harsh conditions on Nauru and Manus Island have been supported by both government and opposition Labor party lawmakers in Australia.
