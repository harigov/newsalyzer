In a mixed decision in the Elian Gonzalez case, a federal appeals court today put off a request by the boy's father to serve as his sole legal representative, which would have effectively ended the court challenge.But, in a blow to the boy's relatives in Miami, the court also denied the relatives' request for regular visits with the 6-year-old Cuban boy, and dismissed their request for the appointment of a neutral guardian. Instead, a psychiatrist and a social worker, both appointed by the federal government, will monitor the boy and send the court biweekly reports on his condition and care, an arrangement first suggested by the government.The three-judge panel also ruled that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has the right to intervene in the battle over whether his son goes back to Cuba or stays here.By offering the twin rulings, the court made two points clear: It does not want to dismiss the case before it has a full hearing on May 11, and it does not want Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle in Miami, to overstep his authority.''It was obvious that Craig attempted to get into the ballgame,'' said Richard Sharpstein, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, referring to Gregory B. Craig, who represents Juan Miguel Gonzalez. ''But he also wanted to take the ball and go home, and the court said no. At this time, they will defer on that.''The greater legal question surrounding the case -- whether Elian has a right to apply for asylum on his own or whether his father speaks for him -- will be presented before the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, at the May 11 hearing.Legal experts offered mixed interpretations of today's ruling on the challenge brought by Lazaro Gonzalez. Some said the ruling denying Mr. Gonzalez's request for a neutral guardian and regular visitation did not bode well for his case.''I think it's kind of the death knell for Lazaro Gonzalez for a couple of reasons,'' said Michael Maggio, an immigration lawyer in Washington. ''By refusing to appoint a guardian, the court is beginning to foreshadow that there is no standing in this case for Lazaro Gonzalez.''But others said that the ruling did not bear directly on the substance of the case, and presaged little about the end result.''By itself, it does not answer any of the questions that are pending,'' said Elliott Lichtman, an immigration lawyer in Washington.In its ruling, the appellate court panel said it was ''hesitant'' to grant Juan Miguel Gonzalez the right to intervene in the case at this late date, but agreed to the request because he was the boy's father. One of the three judges dissented, arguing that the request came too late and that the Immigration and Naturalization Service ''adequately represents'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez's interests.The court also said it would be ''premature'' to decide whether the boy's father should serve as Elian's sole representative. That motion, the judges ruled, will be wrapped into the overall case.With Elian cocooned at the Wye River estate in Maryland, along with his father, stepmother and infant half-brother, four of the boy's kindergarten classmates arrived today at Dulles International Airport on a private plane to join him. Elian is not permitted to leave the country until the appellate court rules on his great-uncle's claim.In a gesture underscoring Havana's interest in both the case and Elian, the Cuban president, Fidel Castro, bid the four children goodbye just before they climbed aboard the jet bound from Havana to Washington, the Reuters news service reported. A pediatrician and the mothers of three of the children accompanied them on their voyage, and one child's father is scheduled to follow.The entourage arrived today waving Cuban flags, on the heels of two other visitors, Elian's cousin and his kindergarten teacher.Tonight, a Cuban government communique said that a doctor traveling with the schoolchildren had medication confiscated by customs officials, and that Cuban officials in Washington had sent a protest letter to President Clinton and the immigration service.With the Senate scheduled to hold a hearing next Wednesday on the raid by armed federal agents who removed Elian from the home in Little Havana where he was staying with his Miami relatives, Attorney General Janet Reno again defended her decision to order the predawn Saturday raid.The Justice Department also supplied figures on how much the Elian case has cost the department.The case has cost more than $578,000 since Thanksgiving Day, when Elian was picked up in the Atlantic, the department said. The preliminary figures do not include costs for Elian's four-day stay at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.Ms. Reno, who grew teary-eyed during the weekly news conference, tried to bolster her decision by suggesting that the heavily armed agents faced a hostile crowd.One immigration agent, Betty Mills, who rushed Elian into a waiting van, was nearly thrown to the ground as she approached the house, Ms. Reno said, and someone inside the house locked the front door and then slid a couch in front of it. The agents had no choice but to ram through the front door, she added.Had she not acted on Saturday before dawn, word of the raid would have spread, Ms. Reno said, and the opportunity would have been lost.''They thought they could ignore us, and we had tried to be very patient with them to effect a voluntary transfer, and then the time comes and the law must be enforced,'' she said.The relatives in Miami and their supporters have provided sharply different accounts of the raid, saying armed agents barreled through the door without announcing themselves, sprayed pepper gas on bystanders and held others inside the house at gunpoint while they seized Elian.Eager to sort out the various descriptions of the raid and question its legality, the Senate Judiciary Committee is likely to call Ms. Reno to testify, along with a group of civic leaders who were involved in last-minute negotiations with the attorney general.In Miami today, Mayor Joseph Carollo fired the city manager, Donald Warshaw, who refused to dismiss the Miami police chief for not warning the mayor about the raid.The police chief, William O'Brien, learned of the raid just before it happened but did not inform the mayor, who had made it clear that he sided with the boy's Miami relatives in defiance of federal officials.Mr. Carollo said he had lost all confidence in his police chief, but Mr. Warshaw balked at carrying out his wishes.The mayor added, however, that he did not fire Mr. Warshaw because of the Elian raid, but because he had been saying bad things about him to others in City Hall.
