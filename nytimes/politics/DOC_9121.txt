TEHRAN —  Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, cautiously welcomed on Tuesday the completion of the nuclear deal and the lifting of economic sanctions last weekend, while at the same time dashing any expectations that the event marked the beginning of a détente with the United States.Hopes of new and more productive relations had been raised after a prisoner swap that released four Americans and swift action to return 10 sailors who ended up in Iran’s territorial waters near an important naval base. In both cases, Obama administration officials said, strong personal relations that were built up during the protracted negotiations on the nuclear agreement proved critical.But on Tuesday, in a letter to President Hassan Rouhani published on his website, Khamenei.ir, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the government to guard vigilantly against American “deceptions,” saying it was time to ensure that Iran’s opponents honor their part of the deal.The comments came amid indications that an influential panel had disqualified hundreds or perhaps thousands of reformists from running in February elections for Parliament or the Assembly of Experts, whose responsibilities include choosing the next supreme leader.While there has not yet been any official confirmation of the disqualifications, the possibility added to the growing recognition that the supreme leader will not allow Mr. Rouhani to extend his foreign policy achievements into more domestic freedoms, as he once promised to do.That would smack of American influence in hard-liners’ eyes, and Ayatollah Khamenei was adamant that Iran’s ideological enemy was still not to be trusted.“The deceptions and breaches of promises by arrogant governments, in particular America, on this issue and other issues, should not be neglected,” Ayatollah Khamenei said in the letter.His warnings seem to have been prompted in part by new United States sanctions over Iran’s ballistic missile program, announced less than 24 hours after the previous sanctions were lifted, and by remarks by conservative members of Congress.Ayatollah Khamenei urged Mr. Rouhani to be on his guard. “The comments made by some American politicians in the last two, three days are cause for deep suspicion,” he wrote.But the warnings also reflect a pattern that goes to the heart of Iran’s opaque and factionalized political system and was visible throughout the nuclear negotiations, as Ayatollah Khamenei played both sides of Iran’s divide between reformers and hard-liners. While praising the work of the negotiators, he frequently laid down “red lines” that seemed to reassure the hard-liners that Iran would not be bullied.That dynamic seems to be playing out in the aftermath of the nuclear deal, with the supreme leader coming down hard on anything or anyone seeming to promote greater freedoms, as the latest dispute underlines.On Sunday, an ally of the president, Hossein Marashi, a reformist leader, said that out of 3,000 reformist candidates who had registered nationwide, only 33 had been allowed to participate. While there is a 20-day appeal period, few analysts think the Guardian Council, which vets candidates for all elections and is dominated by hard-liners, would radically alter its decisions.In the Tehran metropolitan area, Iran’s most populous, only four reformists out of 760 candidates were pronounced qualified to run, one newspaper affiliated with that faction, Arman-e Emrouz, wrote on Monday.Hard-liners said the reformists were trying to make the council look bad by registering thousands of candidates they knew lacked the credentials to qualify. “Their plan is now to undermine the legality of the Guardian Council,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to the hard-line camp. “But even so-called hard-liners have been disqualified. These people just want to create tension.”But reformists argued that the council, like other hard-line factions, was overly sensitive to hints of liberalizing and eager to crack down on anybody who was at all critical of how the country was run. “With or without the nuclear deal, all of them would be disqualified,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst with close ties to Mr. Rouhani. “They simply can’t stand criticism.”Ayatollah Khamenei, in his letter to Mr. Rouhani, also sought to remind the Iranian government that the country had paid a heavy price for the lifting of sanctions, and that no one should be cheerful about the outcome. “Writings and statements that try to ignore this truth and pretend that we are indebted to the Western side are not behaving in a sincere manner toward the public opinion of the people,” he wrote.The lifting of sanctions alone is not enough to revive Iran’s economy, Ayatollah Khamenei wrote, adding that the government must focus on economic policies that promote self-sufficiency and create an “economy of resistance.”The ayatollah said nothing in his letter about the prisoner agreement between Iran and the United States reached over the weekend, in which Iran released five Americans, including four dual citizens, and the United States released seven Iranians, including six dual citizens.Three of the prisoners freed by Iran, Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian and Saeed Abedini, who were reunited with relatives from the United States while undergoing medical checks at American military facilities in Germany, are expected to return home soon.Mr. Hekmati, 32, spoke publicly for the first time about his ordeal in a brief appearance Tuesday outside Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. A Marine veteran, he was the American held the longest in Iran, serving a 10-year term since August 2011. He was accused of aiding a hostile power.“I was at a point where I had just sort of accepted the fact that I was going to be spending 10 years in prison, so this was a surprise, and I just feel truly blessed to see my government do so much for me and the other Americans,” he said.
