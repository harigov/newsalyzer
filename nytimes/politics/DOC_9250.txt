Black students are four times as likely to be suspended from charter schools as white students, according to a new analysis of federal education data. And students with disabilities, the study found, are suspended two to three times the rate of nondisabled students in charter schools.These inequities are similar to those in traditional public schools, where black and disabled students are disproportionately disciplined for even minor infractions, and as early as preschool — although on average, charter schools suspend pupils at slightly higher rates than traditional public schools.The analysis of charter school data from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights of close to 5,000 charters was done by the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California, Los Angeles, a nonprofit civil rights research and policy organization.Still, the report is likely to fuel an often fierce debate about disciplinary practices in charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. Some charter networks have come under fire for “no excuses” behavioral codes, under which students can be suspended for offenses like clothing violations.Based on data from the 2011-12 school year, the report found that charter schools at the elementary, middle and high school levels suspended 7.8 percent of students, compared with 6.7 percent of students in noncharter schools. Among students with disabilities, charter schools suspended 15.5 percent of students, compared with 13.7 percent at noncharters. At the extreme end, there were 235 charter schools that suspended more than half of their students with disabilities.At the elementary school level, less than a third of charter schools suspended more than 10 percent of black students, while at the high school level, close to 40 percent of charter schools suspended one in four or more of black students enrolled that year. Black students were more likely to be suspended at even higher rates when enrolled in segregated schools, with high concentrations of African-American pupils.Daniel J. Losen, the director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies, said the report should not be used to generalize about all charter school discipline, because there were also schools that did not suspend students at high rates. “There are other ways to address school discipline that hold kids accountable,” he said.Advocates for the disabled were particularly concerned about the higher rates of suspension at charters, given that charter schools enroll a lower proportion of students with disabilities than traditional public schools.“So these are the children who manage to get in who are being suspended,” said Diane Smith Howard, senior staff lawyer at the National Disability Rights Network.Education researchers and policy makers worry about out-of-school suspensions because they can raise the risk that students will drop out of high school or lead to higher rates of crime and imprisonment.Research has also shown that black students are suspended for infractions that white students are not, as well as for subjective behavioral categories like defiance or disrespect.Advocates for changes to punitive discipline in schools say educators should be trained to work to resolve conflicts with students rather than using suspension to punish what might be typical childish or adolescent behavior.Teachers and administrators should be “identifying what happened, identifying any needs of the parties involved in the conflict, and asking some really key questions, like ‘what happened, how were you affected, how can we move forward?’ ” said Thena Robinson Mock, director of the Ending the Schoolhouse to Jailhouse Track Campaign sponsored by the Advancement Project, a civil rights group.Charter school advocates advised caution in relying too much on the report for comparisons of charters to traditional public schools.“Parents should have the ability to choose a school that best meets their children’s unique needs,” M. Karega Rausch, vice president for research at the National Association of Charter School Authorizers, a group that represents oversight agencies, said in an email. “For some children, that may be a school with strict rules; for other children, that may be a school that is less strict. ”Schools in the Success Academy network in New York City, which have recently come under scrutiny for disciplinary practices, were not included in the report, as its authors found conflicting suspension data in federal and state databases. Success Academy declined to comment.Michael Yudin, assistant secretary for special education and rehabilitative services at the Department of Education, said in an email that the department would work with charter school leaders “to support the creation of stronger school communities and propose resources and guiding principles that reimagine the role of discipline in their schools.”Crossroads Charter School in Charlotte, N.C., suspended close to three-quarters of all black students in 2011-12. Adrian Sundiata, the operational director at the school, said it was now using more disciplinary measures to address infractions like taking a cellphone to school or using profanity, including after-school detentions and community service.He said school officials were also considering changing some rules, like allowing students to have cellphones to use for research in class.
