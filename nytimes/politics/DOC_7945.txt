LONDON — Markets breathed a sigh of relief on Monday after Emmanuel Macron secured the French presidency in the second round of elections, but investor enthusiasm quickly waned as the focus shifted to the scale of the challenge facing him.The euro, which strengthened against the dollar after results were announced, pared its gains in the European morning and was down 0.32 percent to $1.0954 by early afternoon.The CAC 40, the benchmark stock index for France, had inched down 0.86 percent by early afternoon, while indexes across Europe, including Germany’s DAX and the Euro Stoxx 50, were all a little lower.The yield on French government bonds fell, meaning that investors saw the country’s debt as being less risky, reducing France’s borrowing costs.Mr. Macron comfortably defeated his far-right rival Marine Le Pen on Sunday, but analysts said markets were already looking ahead to French parliamentary elections next month. Mr. Macron faces a sizable challenge in obtaining a legislative majority that could enable him to keep campaign promises.Opinion polls had indicated a Macron victory, helping to bolster investor enthusiasm toward the end of last week, so the market’s reaction to the results was limited, according to Jörg Krämer, the chief economist at Commerzbank.“The biggest uncertainty was before the first round of the elections” in April, when it was unclear whether Mr. Macron would make it to the final round, Mr. Krämer said.“Now there is residual uncertainty,” he said, adding that Mr. Macron was “unlikely to implement the tough necessary reforms that France needs.”Investors were also looking ahead to other elections in Europe, he said, seeing particular risks in parliamentary races in Italy next year.The muted reaction in European markets came after indexes in Asia climbed sharply in the hours after the polls closed in France.The Nikkei 225 share index in Japan and other markets in the region were also reacting to a strong jobs report in the United States on Friday, which suggested the global economy was on solid footing even as it reinforced the case for the Federal Reserve to continue building on recent interest rate increases.
