INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana voters on Tuesday spurned Evan Bayh, a well-known Democrat, in his quest to return to the Senate, instead electing Representative Todd Young, a Republican who found success portraying Mr. Bayh as an interloper tainted by too much time in Washington.Democrats had viewed Mr. Bayh’s candidacy as a prime opportunity to claim an open Senate seat that had been held by a Republican, Dan Coats, and bolster their efforts to gain control of the chamber. Indiana voters are familiar with the Bayh name: Mr. Bayh was popular during stints as governor and senator, and his father, Birch, also represented the state in the Senate.But in addition to funding for Mr. Young’s campaign, Republicans and their allies unleashed $23.5 million in spending against Mr. Bayh. Mr. Young, who represents part of southern Indiana, found success framing Mr. Bayh as an outsider whose connections to Indiana had eroded. Mr. Bayh, 60, who left Congress about six years ago, did not help matters when he gave an interviewer the wrong address of the Indianapolis condominium he claims as his home. His work as a consultant for a lobbying firm was also scrutinized closely.“Evan Bayh had his chance, but he put money ahead of us,” Mr. Young, 44, a former Marine, said in one advertisement.Mr. Bayh sought to portray himself as a moderate with deep Indiana roots, pledging to “reject the extremes of both parties.” He appeared in one ad playing driveway basketball, one of the state’s favorite pastimes, with his sons. But the comment section of that video underscored Mr. Bayh’s challenge in returning home. “Wonder whose driveway you borrowed,” wrote one viewer.
