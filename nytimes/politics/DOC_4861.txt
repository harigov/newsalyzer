WASHINGTON — The federal government will impose stiff penalties starting this spring on airlines that keep passengers waiting too long on the tarmac without feeding them or letting them off the plane — a remedy that will relieve many travelers but mean longer delays for a few.The Obama administration took the strict new approach in response to several highly publicized events in recent years, and in the face of likely Congressional action if airline regulators did not respond to the consumer outcry that ensued.It acted on the eve of the busy Christmas travel season, and just as airlines struggled to recover from extensive weather-related disruptions to air travel to and from the Northeast over the weekend.Under the rule, airlines that do not provide food and water after two hours or a chance to disembark after three hours will face penalties of $27,500 a passenger, the secretary of transportation announced  on Monday.In recent years, relatively few flights have been held on the ground for more than three hours — about 1,500 a year, or roughly one out of 6,200 flights — but that has been enough to affect more than 100,000 passengers a year and to create substantial public resentment.“This is President Obama’s Passenger Bill of Rights,” said the secretary, Ray LaHood, using the term favored by proponents of like-minded legislation that is before Congress. The administration’s action does not require Congressional approval.But the airlines predicted that the rule would create a new set of complications and might force them to put more breathing room into their schedules.Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, said the penalty was so high that the airlines were “going to have to re-engineer to fix the problem,” by smoothing out their schedules, for example. “This is awfully serious business,” he said.If some passengers wanted to get off a flight, the plane would have to abandon its place in the line waiting for takeoff, taxi back to the gate and wait while baggage handlers removed luggage, said David A. Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major carriers.At this time of year, the plane then may have to go through de-icing again, Mr. Castelveter said. As delays mounted, he added, there was a far higher chance that the crew would be unable to continue, given the limits on their working hours.“There will be more cancellations than there are today,” he said.Others in the industry also suggested that some passengers would face unnecessary delays as airlines adjusted their practices to steer clear of the penalties, which could amount to millions of dollars for a violation on a single flight.But passenger advocates were ecstatic that airlines would have to pay more attention to human comfort.Kate Hanni, who founded FlyersRights.org after she was stuck with her family for nine hours on a plane diverted from Dallas to Austin, called it “a Christmas miracle.”The rule, which applies only to domestic flights, is set to go into force in four months.Its effects will differ from airport to airport. Planes are sometimes held on the ground in fine weather at uncongested airports because of a problem at the destination airport, and in those cases, making an extra stop at the terminal to let passengers off may cost the airlines nothing unless travelers eventually have to take seats on other flights. Or the plane may be waiting on a ramp near the terminal.In other cases, it could be more complicated, as planes may be far from the terminal, and the rule specifies that they arrive back at the gate within three hours, not that they turn around after three hours.Asked what would happen if air traffic control told a pilot that takeoff clearance would be in five minutes but that would put it over three hours, Mr. LaHood told reporters, “You know as well as I do that five minutes always extends out to 50 minutes, and almost always to five hours. There’s no such thing as five minutes, never, ever.”Airlines, he said, should provide safe service and do it “in a way that is halfway convenient.”The Transportation Department counts minutes of delay month by month. Nearly all of it is  accumulated in small increments, and long delays occur sporadically. In the first 10 months of this year, flights delayed four hours or more on the tarmac have ranged from 29 in July to zero in October.The main causes are weather and air traffic problems, which are often weather-related. The airlines say that the trend in lengthy delays is down, and that they are already taking steps like putting more food and beverages on board, and working with airports  to design trucks that can service planes on the tarmac and remove passengers who want to get off.But the intermittent horror stories are the stuff of legend. In January 1999, Northwest Airlines stranded thousands of passengers on planes on snow-covered taxiways and ramps in Detroit. In a strategic blunder, the airline kept landing planes even though there was no way to get them to the terminal. The airline eventually settled legal claims from passengers for more than $7 million.On Feb. 14, 2007, JetBlue stranded passengers by the planeload at its hub at Kennedy International Airport in New York.The rule  announced on Monday  has been in the works since 2007, but was accelerated by events in August, when a cramped regional jet flown by ExpressJet for Continental Express sat on the tarmac at Rochester, Minn., overnight with 47 passengers.The flight had been diverted to Rochester unexpectedly while waiting for the weather to clear at its intended destination, Minneapolis. Continental Express does not have gates at Rochester, and an employee of Mesaba Airlines, which does, told the Continental Express captain that because the Transportation Security Administration screeners had gone home for the night, the passengers could not be let into the terminal.That was incorrect. In November, the Transportation Department ruled that all three airlines were guilty  of deceptive practices and assessed a civil penalty of $175,000.Under the new rule, the penalty, payable to the Treasury Department, could have been more than $1.2 million.But Mr. LaHood said that if a plane’s returning to the terminal would cause a safety problem or interfere with operations at the airport, airlines would not be penalized.While the Rochester case was an extreme example, the Transportation Department said that for 2007 and 2008, there was an average of 1,500 flights a year, with 114,000 passengers, held on the tarmac for more than three hours.Department officials said, though, that with a rule in place, the number of such delays was certain to fall.Airplanes that do not carry any food on short flights would have to start carrying snacks for emergencies, Mr. LaHood said.“They’re going to have to have peanuts, pretzels on their regional jets; they’re going to have to start stocking up,” he said.
