For 16 years, Zhang Yue hosted a popular women’s talk show, “Half the Sky” — named after Mao Zedong’s famous proclamation that “Women Hold Up Half the Sky” — on the state broadcaster CCTV.It was canceled last year as part of broader restructuring, Ms. Zhang said. “That was a real pity. We could need it, say, once a week.”One of two daughters — considered a small family in the 1960s — Ms. Zhang remembers how her mother, of the generation that supposedly benefited from Mao Zedong’s decreed gender equality, worked all day and into the night.“Women labored outside the home, just like men, but when they got home they had to do everything,” Ms. Zhang, 46, said.“My mother got home from work when it was already dark,” she said. “Then she had to prepare everything for the evening meal, meals for us for the next day, she had to cook, clean and sew. Women discovered that equality meant a double burden.”“The Chinese Revolution and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China brought about really enormous changes in the lives of women,” said Gail Hershatter, a history professor and expert on Chinese women at the University of California, Santa Cruz.“I don’t see any happy ending, but if you ask anybody, ‘Do you prefer the situation we have now today or the situation in the collective era?’ most people will say, ‘We’ll take now,”’ she said.Like many Chinese feminists, Ms. Zhang takes a long-term view.China’s first women’s magazine, Nubao, or “Women’s Newspaper,” set up in 1899 under the Qing dynasty, had five goals, she said, listing them: “Abolish foot-binding, educate girls, free marriage, a job, equality with men. We got the first four. But not the last one.”
