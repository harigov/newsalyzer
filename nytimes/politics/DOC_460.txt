To the Editor:Re “The Spirit of Liu Xiaobo” (editorial, July 14):The death of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo after years of incarceration is another black mark on China’s human rights record. I believe that my husband, Edgar Snow, would be appalled by the punishment meted out to Mr. Liu for the crime of speaking his mind and for his peaceful actions to defend fundamental freedoms.How ironic that the Chinese government today is practicing the same kind of oppression and abuse of power that Mao Zedong’s revolutionary forces were struggling against when my husband defied government censorship to write about them in 1936.It is an outrage that Mr. Liu’s wife, the poet Liu Xia, has been under house arrest since 2010 for no other reason than her marriage to Mr. Liu. The Chinese government should immediately heed the widespread call to lift all the restrictions it has placed on Liu Xia and allow her full freedom of movement.LOIS WHEELER SNOWEYSINS, SWITZERLANDThe writer is the widow of Edgar Snow, the author of “Red Star Over China.”
