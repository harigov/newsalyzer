AYOTZINAPA, Mexico —  In their first week of school, the new students eat and drink nothing but beans and cold coffee, and spend sleepless days cleaning up the buildings and planting crops.It is a “boot camp” to foster a sense of community and prove that they really want to be here at the Escuela Normal Rural Raúl Isidro Burgos. The small teachers’ college in southern Mexico has been at the center of a national crisis since 43 of its students disappeared in September after a violent confrontation with the local police force, which has been infiltrated by a drug gang.The school’s students read books on Marxism, have weekly discussions on political documentaries championing leftist causes and try to adhere to the social justice ideals underpinning the school since its founding in 1926 after the Mexican Revolution, one of several such schools begun to keep alive its fires of social transformation.“It was not only about the academic stuff but the political side of it, the risk of the activities they did and the sense of belonging,” said Ricardo Jacinto, a student there, explaining why he and his brother Israel, 19, as well as two uncles have attended the school.Now, Ricardo and his family are awaiting word of Israel, one of the students missing since Sept. 26.Israel was part of a large group of students who went to the industrial city of Iguala, about two hours away and 120 miles south of Mexico City, to collect money for school activities and to steal two buses to help transport them to demonstrations on Oct. 2 commemorating a 1968 student massacre in Mexico City.The appropriation of the buses — routine and temporary, students here say — was a function of the threadbare life and revolutionary ferment running through the school, where portraits of Che Guevara and other socialist figures line the walls and students are taught to push the boundaries in their protests.They have routinely blocked highways and these days have regularly taken over tollbooths on superhighways in southern Mexico, asking for donations while federal police officers sit nearby, apparently unwilling to risk a confrontation.Such tactics have often put them at odds with the local authorities, who have viewed them suspiciously and question their ties to leftist guerrilla and political groups in the state, Guerrero, one of the most violent and prone to social and criminal upheaval. In the search for the students, the authorities have uncovered several mass graves containing a total of 38 bodies, though initial tests indicate that none are the missing students.The school’s students, in turn, often rage over what they consider to be shortfalls in state financing, job placement and other support for the school, 70 miles northeast of the resort city of Acapulco.In 2011, during a protest blocking the main highway between Mexico City and Acapulco, the police shot and killed two students from the school in the state capital, Chilpancingo, just to the west of here.“We have a popular saying here that goes, ‘If you found the door slightly open, try to open it a bit more, never close it,’ ” said a student leader who wanted to be identified by his nickname, Acapulco, out of fear that gangs may target him or his family.The Jacinto family knew well the school’s history but, like other families, viewed the school as one of the few viable options for a life outside farming and other lower-wage jobs.In some cases, generations of families, drawn largely from rural hamlets across the state and some neighboring ones, attend the school, which is named after the poet and educator who helped build it.The latest in the Jacinto family to attend was Israel. His family described him as a smiley but timid boy known as Gordito because he was chubby. With a deep interest in cars, he initially thought of becoming a mechanic.“I told him he would always be covered in oil, that he should study something else like medicine or law,” his father, Israel Sr., who lives in San Jose, Calif., said the other day by phone. “He came to me a week later and said he would become a teacher.”The free tuition and room and board made the school more attractive. He passed the required entrance exam, paid the $40 fee for cleaning materials and enrolled in June, taking the indoctrination in stride, though he complained to his father of the physical demands of cleaning and maintenance duties. He sent a picture of himself with his hair shorn.Like other new students, he threw himself into growing chickpeas, coriander and flowers on the school property, some of which are sold to help support the school, which has 520 students.The students live in crowded dorms. Laundry hangs on lines outside classrooms, and stray dogs roam about.They try to abide by the slogans strewn across almost every wall, like “The student life is a deep stamp we will carry like a shield.”“Before coming here, I had a blindfold, I couldn’t see many things,” said one 19-year-old student leader, Ulises. Like Acapulco, he would allow only his nickname to be used. “Here you become much more analytical, you develop a real conscience.”Still, the Jacintos never expected life-threatening turmoil for their sons.The authorities now believe that the mayor of Iguala had close ties to the drug gang and ordered the police to round up the students before they interrupted a speech his wife, a social services official in town, was giving. In the confusion and chaos, the police opened fire, killing six people, including three students, and detained several others, who were turned over to the gang, federal officials have said.The students here flatly deny any connection to drug or organized crime gangs and dismiss reports in some local news media that they may have gotten confused with a rival gang operating in the area. They say they have no formal ties to armed guerrilla movements in the state, other than sharing their socialist principles.But they do admit to employing radical tactics, including throwing rocks at the police, blocking roads and stealing buses. Their extreme protests are the only way to draw attention to the school’s needs, including class materials and transportation, they say.“This has always been a combative and militant school, no doubt,” Ricardo Jacinto said. “We fight for our rights, and this is often considered ‘guerrilla’ in this country.”Israel’s last contact was with his brother Ricardo, who received a text from Israel saying the police had surrounded the bus he was on with their guns pointed at it but that “he was O.K. and not to worry,” Ricardo said. Ricardo reached him by phone and told him to stay calm, but when he tried to call the phone again shortly afterward there was no answer.Last week, Ernestina and Ricardo Jacinto were among the family members of the missing students who met for hours with President Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico City.He greeted all of them personally. Some wept, and a few barely concealed their anger, with one stating that he regretted having voted for the president.But most came away frustrated and angry.“It was practically like any of the other meetings with high-level public officials we have had, where they don’t say anything new,” Ricardo Jacinto said.He and his mother sat the other day in an empty classroom; the students said classes had been suspended since their peers disappeared.“How is it possible that my poor Gordito had such bad luck?” she said through tears. “How is it possible that we have such misfortune?”
