The latest fight over so-called net neutrality has not reached — at least not yet — the fevered pitch it did a couple of years ago, when the Federal Communications Commission, egged on by President Barack Obama, approved rules regulating broadband internet like a utility.At the time, there was a clear opponent of the new rules that helped raise the volume: broadband companies.Now, as the new leadership of the Federal Communications Commission moves to scrap the rules, the same broadband companies, including Comcast and Verizon, are taking a less obvious position, Farhad Manjoo writes.While hundreds of internet companies protested the potential changes on Wednesday — by doing things like putting prominent banners on their sites — the broadband companies said that they were behind them, at least in theory. The broadband companies insisted that they, too, were for an open internet. The difference, the broadband companies say, is that they would like any rules to come out of Congress, not the F.C.C.So Farhad has a thought: The longtime supporters of net neutrality should take it to Congress and see what happens. Then the broadband companies would really need to take a stand, he says, “and maybe, finally, end the debate for good.”That may well be wishful thinking. This latest round of debate about the F.C.C. plans is really just heating up, and it is bound to get louder and louder in the months ahead. It will be interesting to see how much of the talking comes from the broadband companies.
