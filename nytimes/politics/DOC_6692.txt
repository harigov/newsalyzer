President Obama will visit flood-ravaged Louisiana on Tuesday, a trip that comes four days after Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, made a visit of his own.Mr. Obama’s tour of the Baton Rouge area comes amid criticism from local officials that the president declined to interrupt his vacation on Martha’s Vineyard. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, has also not visited the area.Mr. Trump’s visit was initially criticized by the staff of Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat. But Mr. Edwards praised Mr. Trump’s visit as helpful in an interview with CNN over the weekend.Mr. Trump took a victory lap after Mr. Obama’s planned visit was announced, insisting that he had prodded the trip. White House officials say that is not the case.Louisiana has been the site of some of the nation’s worst disasters over the last 15 years, and Mr. Obama’s trip will inevitably be compared to the performance of another president, George W. Bush, his Republican predecessor who was harshly criticized for his handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.The Obama administration’s response has been praised, even as Mr. Obama’s own presence has been criticized. But everything is taking place against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential election, and for Mr. Obama, who hopes to help get Mrs. Clinton elected, every action has a potential consequence.
