WASHINGTON —  Representative Alan Grayson, Democrat of Florida, may have improperly used his House office and staff to handle personal financial matters involving a family-run hedge fund as well as political activities related to his bid for the United States Senate, the Office of Congressional Ethics concluded in a 986-page investigation released Tuesday.The report, which found as many as a half dozen violations of House rules,  provoked an angry response from Mr. Grayson, who accused the quasi-independent agency of conspiring with his Democratic opponent for the Senate seat.“I didn’t do anything wrong,” Mr. Grayson said repeatedly in a telephone news conference after the report was released.The exchange came on the same day that the House Ethics Committee — the only entity that has formal powers to sanction a House lawmaker — announced that it was still studying the case and that, at least for now, it would not create a formal investigative panel to examine possible misconduct charges against Mr. Grayson.Tuesday was the deadline for the Ethics Committee to release the once-confidential report prepared by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which serves almost like a grand jury, making recommendations to lawmakers on the Ethics Committee about whether it should investigate possible misconduct by lawmakers.The inquiry began last year after the Office of Congressional Ethics received at least two complaints against Mr. Grayson, focused primarily on whether he had violated House rules by continuing to operate a hedge fund while serving in Congress. House rules prohibit lawmakers from using their name to promote professional services firms that involve a fiduciary responsibility.The Congressional Ethics staff — made up of professional investigators overseen by a six-member board — found at least six possible violations of House rules or law, including improperly allowing what was until 2015 known as the Grayson Hedge Fund to use his name and relying on one of his House staff members to handle hedge fund business matters, including sending her emails on her government account.Mr. Grayson, the ethics office found, also filed at least one incomplete financial disclosure report that left off nearly $1 million he had received in 2009 from a law firm he once helped run. And he may have illegally, through a limited partnership he had invested in named CVR Refining, held contracts to sell jet fuel to the Defense Department.The investigators also found that he might have improperly maintained, even after joining Congress, an interest in lawsuits that involved the federal government — alleging improper acts by defense contractors — despite a ban on members of Congress from being involved in such litigation.Mr. Grayson called each of these allegations minor missteps on his part or entirely unjustified conjecture by the Office of Congressional Ethics.“The referral itself verges on the demented, in all of its Captain Ahab attempts to spear the white whale by coming up with something — anything — with which to try to argue that some unethical conduct has occurred,” Mr. Grayson’s lawyer, Brett G. Kappel, wrote in a formal response to the Office of Congressional Ethics report.On the most central question of his hedge fund, Mr. Grayson said he had never solicited new investors while in Congress, and had not violated any rules prohibiting lawmakers from using their own names to promote professional services firms, because he did not have a fiduciary responsibility to his two outside investors.
