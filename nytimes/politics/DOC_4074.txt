LONDON — Oil companies need to go where the oil is. And with the increasing likelihood that international sanctions on Iran will be lifted, it is no surprise that European oil executives like Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, and Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Eni of Italy, have met in recent months with Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh.European companies have been sending small teams to Iran to find out what might be available once they receive a green light, probably in early 2016.American oil companies, subject to tighter restrictions than their European counterparts, are being far more cautious, industry executives say. The companies worry that they may find themselves at a disadvantage against international competitors because the deal reached between Iran and the United States and five other countries could leave American sanctions in place.“The primary commitment by the United States under the Iran nuclear deal is the easing of sanctions that impose limits on access to the U.S. financial system and other restraints on foreign companies that do certain business with Iran,” said David Horn, a lawyer who advises on sanctions at WilmerHale in Washington. “The U.S. commitment does not include most of the sanctions that have prevented U.S. companies themselves from Iranian business.”Mr. Horn said that, while the agreement with Iran did provide for new authorization for foreign subsidiaries of American companies to work in Iran, they must await the United States government’s clarification of the details to assess precisely how much freedom they will have.Though Iranian officials favor the participation of companies from the United States, American executives say they are wary of any contact with the Iranians until the situation is much clearer. Companies are also likely to be careful about making large investment commitments at a time when they are shelving other projects because oil prices remain low.Iran, which has been producing oil and gas for more than a century, has enough resources in the ground to offer the Western oil industry lucrative deals, executives say. Iran leads the world in natural gas reserves and is fourth in oil, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.But oil experts caution that it may be some time before major new oil and gas projects get underway.“The level of interest in Iran will be high, but actual investment will be slow,” said David Goldwyn, who served as international energy coordinator in the United States Department of State under Hillary Rodham Clinton.These are among the reasons that Iranian oil production is likely to rise more slowly than the sudden surge to one million barrels a day that some Iranian officials have forecast.In addition, Iran will probably want to avoid starting a price war with Saudi Arabia, the leading producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the research firm IHS Energy in Washington, said that to avoid roiling an oversupplied market, Iran might not increase its production by much more than about 200,000 barrels per day in the first couple of months after sanctions are lifted, from the current 2.9 million barrels per day.IHS anticipates that Iran’s production will continue to rise in subsequent months, reaching around 3.4 million barrels per day by the end of 2016, assuming that sanctions are lifted next spring.“It’s not in Iran’s interest to collapse the oil price and duke it out with Saudi Arabia by suddenly putting an additional half a million barrels a day of oil in glutted markets,” Mr. Bahree said.Western investment and technology could help revive an industry that in a decade of sanctions has lost much ground to rivals like Iraq and Saudi Arabia.Iranian oil production has declined more than 20 percent to about 2.9 million barrels per day since 2009, while Iraq has added nearly 70 percent. The Saudis have been pumping at near-record levels. Bringing Iranian output back to and above pre-sanction levels may require more capital investment than the National Iranian Oil Company can muster at a time of low prices.Such investments will flow only if sanctions are lifted, but executives say that much also depends on whether the Iranians are willing to let outside investors make money from extracting their country’s resources.“For sure the Iranian oil sector has a lot of potential, but to move from potential to a good opportunity will be defined by the contract,” said an executive at a European oil company, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the subject.Before sanctions effectively closed Iran to Western companies, European companies operating there were frustrated by the tough fiscal terms and tight controls imposed by the Iranians, who Western operators say permitted only modest returns on capital at best.Iranian officials have said at conferences that they are consulting potential Western partners and working out an improved contract that will be announced in the next few months, but Western oil executives say they have yet to learn important details.Homayoun Falakshahi, an Iran specialist at the Edinburgh-based consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, said the terms the Iranians offer were likely to seek to address Western concerns while preserving Iranian priorities. For instance, he said, Iran is unlikely to offer production-sharing agreements under which the foreign companies have a kind of ownership of reserves or resources in the oil fields where they invest.Instead, the Iranians are likely to seek deals in which they pay a fee per barrel for the increases in output achieved by the Western companies’ technology and investment, Mr. Falakshahi said.The contracts are likely to be longer than the five to eight years of the past, with fees that slide according to the oil price, in order to give the companies potential upside, he said.The model for these deals, he said, is likely to be the contracts handed out by Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. “We think the Iranians are going to compete mainly with Iraq,” he said. “They have looked at the Iraqi contracts and how to make them better.”Iranian officials will also try to achieve the greatest increases in production for the least money.A facet of Iran’s strategy, analysts say, will probably be to try to increase natural gas production so as to be able to inject the fuel into aging Iranian oil fields. According to these analysts, Iran may also want to develop fields near the Iraqi border, to prevent Baghdad from gaining all the benefits from these fields.If these prospects do not sound like a bonanza, that is because they may not be. As one Western oil executive put it, for international companies most of the opportunities in the Middle East are about helping national oil companies extend the lives and the production of aging fields.
