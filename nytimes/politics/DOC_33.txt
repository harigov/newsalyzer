New York Times reporters and editors are highlighting great stories from around the web. You can receive What We’re reading by email, and let us know how you like it at wwr@nytimes.com.From Los Angeles Times: This story about the secret, drug-fueled party life of the dean of the University of Southern California medical school is jaw-dropping. Kudos to The L.A. Times for an amazing investigation. — Julie Bloom, California and the West editor, National Desk_____From The New York Times: More partisan writing you shouldn’t miss. Writers from across the political spectrum on the collapse of the health care bill and other news of the week. — Justin Bank, senior editor, internet and audience_____From Bitter Southerner: Why do so many people, when they hear the word “trailer” follow it immediately with “trash?” David Joy, a dazzling 33-year-old Southern writer, takes readers to the lands of trailers and churches in his native North Carolina, writing beautifully and memorably “about poverty and hopelessness, addiction and violence,” but also about friendship and laughter and strength and a kind of stubborn resilience. If one message of the 2016 election is that we must know worlds other than our own, we can ask for no better guide than David Joy. — Carolyn Ryan, assistant masthead editor_____From The Daily News: This writer asks whether police brutality has “jumped the racial fence” with the killing of an unarmed white yoga instructor in her pajamas who called the Minneapolis police to her home for help. What I find deeply fascinating in this piece is the concept of “mirror neurons.” When you see something happening to someone who looks like you, or reminds you of yourself, neurons in your brain fire off almost as though you’re experiencing it yourself. — Lynda Richardson, senior staff editor, Travel_____From High Country News: In Alaska’s rural villages, where a bag of Doritos costs $11 and almost everyone is cash poor, a teenager caught a 57-foot whale. Before the internet, he would have been a hero, praised for his skill as a hunter and for the meat he brought to the village. But then the trolls found him. — Kim Severson, national food correspondent_____From Sixth Tone: China’s imaginary Hu Line, named for the demographer that first traced it, bisects the country diagonally between its most and least populated regions. On one side are China’s industrialized cities and most of its infrastructure; on the other, pristine landscapes and most of the country’s ethnic minorities. Tag along on a five-week road trip. — Jennifer Jett, senior staff editor, Hong Kong_____From Thrillist: Here’s a conversation- starter. What are the best movie props of all time? This article will give you 100 to consider, spread across decades and genres, along with their back stories. The rankings here may be the subject of lively debate, but it’s hard to dispute the idea that objects can be powerful supporting players. — Gina Lamb, deskhead, projects_____From Mashable: The Times is deliberately distancing itself from its past as a factory product — a thing of metal, muscle, cigarette smoke and sweat. There is almost nothing recognizable about the day in this newspaper’s life that was captured by the photographer Marjory Collins on Sept. 9, 1942, and is preserved at the Library of Congress. But her lucidly narrative pictures of the newsroom, composing room, press room, reel room and mail room bring the exertions of that day so vividly to life you can almost smell the sweat. — David Dunlap, reporter, architecture and the environment_____From The Times archives: Frank Lloyd Wright took a dim view of air conditioning, even in scorching summers. In an excerpt from his 1954 manifesto, “The Natural House,” that was printed in The Times 20 years after his death, the architect asserts that “the extreme changes in temperature that tear down a building also tear down the human body.” — Jennifer Parrucci, Senior Taxonomist_____
