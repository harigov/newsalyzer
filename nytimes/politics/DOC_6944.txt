President Trump has made it clear that he thinks drug prices are too high and that the pharmaceutical industry, as he put it at a news conference this month, is “getting away with murder.”He joins a host of lawmakers and others who have excoriated drug makers in recent years for high-priced drugs that are out of the reach of many Americans. On Monday, Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, reaffirmed that the issue would be a priority.One of Mr. Trump’s proposals — to force drug makers to bid for the right to sell their products to Medicare beneficiaries — has repeatedly failed to attract enough support in Congress, especially among his fellow Republicans.“Pharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power, and there is very little bidding,” Mr. Trump said at the news conference this month, in comments that briefly sent pharmaceutical stocks tumbling. “We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don’t bid properly, and we’re going to save billions of dollars.”Polls show that the public is in favor of doing away with a legislative provision that prohibits the federal government from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs that are paid for by Medicare, the government health care program for people who are over 65 or have disabilities.Removing that prohibition is a favorite cause of liberal politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but it has been opposed by the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee for secretary of health and human services.Mr. Price declined to say at a confirmation hearing last Wednesday whether he supported Mr. Trump’s position, and Democratic senators are likely to question him again on the issue when he appears before the Senate Finance Committee for another hearing on Tuesday.Whether freeing the government to negotiate on drug prices would lower costs, however, is anything but clear. And its chances of passing a Republican-led Congress are even less so.Medicare did not cover prescription drugs until 2006, after Congress expanded the program to add a drug benefit, known as Part D. But the measure included something called the noninterference clause, which was backed by the pharmaceutical industry and prevented the federal government from negotiating directly with drug makers.This prohibition does not mean that pharmaceutical companies can set any price they want. Privately run prescription drug programs, which control the benefits for large groups of Medicare beneficiaries, negotiate on the government’s behalf. These programs are run by the same companies — including Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth — that manage the drug plans for large employers and insurers.Those who favor letting the federal government negotiate directly on drug prices argue that other countries, including Canada and Britain, already have that leverage with many multinational drug corporations. Their government-run health programs are the only game in town and hold significant power in setting drug prices. Supporters say that if the United States government were allowed to negotiate drug prices for all 41 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in drug coverage, it would lead to lower prices across the health care market.The pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have long opposed such a change, however, saying that significantly cutting payments to drug makers would stifle innovation and prevent them from investing in new lifesaving drugs.Many health care experts are skeptical that a repeal of the negotiating ban would have much impact, and certainly not the “billions” of dollars in reductions that Mr. Trump recently promised. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has concluded more than once that a repeal would result in only modest savings, in part because private drug plans are already negotiating on the government’s behalf, albeit for smaller pools of beneficiaries.And even if the ban were repealed, another provision would stand in the way. Under Medicare, the government must cover all drugs in six “protected classes”: broad and often expensive treatment areas for patients with conditions such as cancer, depression, epilepsy and H.I.V.The Veterans Health Administration and the Defense Department are able to negotiate lower prices in part by covering fewer drugs and pitting drug companies against one another.“You get your largest negotiating power from your ability to walk away,” said Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who has written frequently on drug prices.Even if Medicare were to remove those protections and agree to cover fewer drugs — a politically unpopular move that has failed in the past — drug companies might find ways to make up the financial losses, said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm that works for drug companies, hospitals, insurers and others.Today’s most expensive drugs typically treat rare conditions, like cystic fibrosis and certain types of cancer, for which there are few options. In those cases, drug companies hold the bargaining power, no matter who is on the other side of the table.“I worry that if you force one price across the market, you may well end up with a higher price in noncompetitive categories than you would otherwise,” Mr. Mendelson said.And even if the negotiating ban were lifted, the United States would still not have the same clout as, say, Britain, whose universal health care coverage makes the government the country’s only buyer of drugs.Some worry that if the United States government were to significantly lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, pharmaceutical companies would respond by raising prices for the millions of people insured through large employers or private insurers. Others contend that if the prices negotiated by Medicare were public, the transparency could level the playing field and lower prices across the board.During the campaign, Mr. Trump joined his Democratic opponents, Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton, in calling for the federal government to be allowed to negotiate the price of drugs.After his election, the drug industry exhaled when the health care section of his transition website included more traditional Republican (and industry-friendly) priorities and did not mention the negotiation provision.In December, Mr. Trump pledged in an interview with Time magazine to bring down drug prices, and this month, he promised to “create new bidding procedures” but did not offer specific details.It seems unlikely, given that Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate.“It’s been a nonstarter with Republicans, and it’s the traditionally Democratic talking point,” said Alana Dovner, a research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, which advises investors on developments in Washington. “Something as dramatic as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices — that would be such a radical change, and so opposite the traditional Republican health care policies, that it just seems unfathomable at this point.”Mr. Price opposed a Democratic-led measure in 2007, calling it a “solution in search of a problem.”Ms. Dovner and others said that even Democrats were unlikely to support a measure that would allow Medicare to stop covering drugs in protected areas like cancer. A limited effort to do that in 2014 failed amid bipartisan criticism.“You are by definition saying yes to some drugs and no to others,” Mr. Mendelson said. He called that position politically dangerous, saying it would be denounced as “government practice of medicine.”
