Nicholas MaggioAge 35Occupation PhotographerLocation Los AngelesHis Favorite Place The Spanish-style duplex apartment Mr. Maggio rents near Beverly Hills. Dark and masculine, the space is filled with, as Mr. Maggio put it, “those rich textures that are cliché pimp ’70s.”What do you love about it here? It’s very me, the weird mix of stuff. I have these big, comfortable modern sofas, and then that burlwood credenza, and then I have this ridiculous river rock coffee table. It’s the cheesiest, but I thought it would be so rad to mix it with this stuff. It’s obvious that a designer didn’t put it together. Nothing in my house makes sense. I have an ’80s Santa Cruz skateboard banner framed.What I love about your house is the way it refutes the light, airy image of the Southern California interior. When I think of L.A. interiors, I go to Tony Duquette and the old-school Hollywood dark and opulent homes. The rich tones, the jewel tones. That’s what I love about L.A. interiors. My place is just dark, so even if the walls are white, it would still be dark. It’s a cave, but it’s a soft cave.Do you have a girlfriend? What does she think? My girlfriend loves the place. She also likes white walls, too, so some things might have to change.I see a Cire Trudon candle on the bookshelf. I’m going to guess that it’s Ernesto. I do love the Ernesto, because it smells like Hemingway’s breath. But that’s Carmélite.I can tell you put a lot of thought into your décor. My girl says I live in a museum because everything is on display. Books are at right corners. I make my bed before I get out of it. That’s just how I am.
