Comcast announced on Monday that it had hired Michael J. Cavanagh as its chief financial officer, choosing a prominent Wall Street executive to help the company move forward after the collapse of its proposed $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable.Mr. Cavanagh most recently worked as co-president and co-chief operating officer of the Carlyle Group, a global asset management firm in New York. He will join Comcast early this summer and be based at its Philadelphia headquarters.He succeeds Michael J. Angelakis, who had been Comcast’s chief financial officer since 2008. In March, Comcast announced that Mr. Angelakis was leaving his post to start a Comcast-backed company with $4 billion in financing to make strategic investments in the United States and abroad.

He worked for about six years as JPMorgan’s chief financial officer during the financial crisis.
