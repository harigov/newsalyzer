A wage panel recommended on Wednesday that the minimum wage be raised for employees of fast-food chain restaurants in New York State to $15 an hour. At a rally later in the day for workers and their supporters, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said, “There is no doubt we are headed in the right direction.” But questions remain on what exactly is next. Following are a few answers:When would the proposed change take place? The three-member panel, which was formed in May to investigate and make recommendations for a minimum wage raise, suggested yearly increments to phase in the increase. The current wage is $8.75 an hour.In New York City, hourly pay would increase to:• $10.50 on Dec. 31; • $12 on Dec. 31, 2016;• $13.50 on Dec. 31, 2017; and• $15 on Dec. 31, 2018.For the rest of the state, the minimum wage would increase to:• $9.75 on Dec. 31;• $10.75 on Dec. 31, 2016;• $11.75 on Dec. 31, 2017;• $12.75 on Dec. 31, 2018;• $13.75 on Dec. 31, 2019;• $14.50 on Dec. 31, 2020; and• $15 on July 1, 2021What qualifies as a fast-food establishment? As defined by the wage board, a fast-food establishment in New York serves food and drinks where:• It is part of a chain, with 30 or more national establishments;• Patrons pay for their order before consuming items at the business or after items are delivered to a customer’s location; and• It offers limited service.What if some workers earn slightly more than the current minimum wage, would they earn more than $15? Employers will have to decide how the change will affect workers who earn more than the minimum. But economists say they expect more workers will be paid the minimum when it rises to $15 an hour.Is it possible that employers could reduce hours or staffing? Some fast-food restaurants are expected to raise prices to offset this increase in labor costs. Economists say that this change in the minimum wage does not significantly affect employment, but some fast-food restaurants say they will have no choice but to reduce hours and hire fewer workers.What is next? The board is expected to meet on Monday to approve its report, which will be published and then followed by a 15-day public comment period. Based on those comments, the state labor commissioner can decide to accept, reject or modify the board’s recommendations and file a wage order. The final decision, or order, is subject to additional regulations.
