WASHINGTON — The Obama administration’s leading foreign policy ally in Congress said Wednesday that aid to Iraq might be made contingent on cutting off flights shuttling military supplies from Iran to the repressive government in Syria.Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, warned at a confirmation hearing for the nominee for ambassador to Iraq that the mood in Congress was not generous toward recipients of foreign aid that “seem to be trying to have it both ways.”The administration has been protesting for at least a month the resumption in July of flights that Iraq’s government has allowed to cross uninspected over Iraqi territory to Syria from Iran, in violation of international sanctions.“If so many people have entreated the government to stop and that doesn’t seem to be having an impact,” Mr. Kerry said, “that sort of alarms me a little bit and seems to send a signal to me maybe we should make some of our assistance or some of our support contingent on some kind of appropriate response.”He continued: “It just seems completely inappropriate that we’re trying to help build their democracy, support them, put American lives on the line, money into the country, and they’re working against our interest so overtly.”The nominee, Robert S. Beecroft, a career Foreign Service officer who is already running the huge Baghdad embassy as chargé d’affaires, said that the United States was adamant that Iran should not be permitted to airlift arms to Syria.He and other officials have “made very clear that we find this unacceptable and we find it unhelpful and detrimental to the region and to Iraq and, of course, first and foremost, to the Syrian people,” Mr. Beecroft said.The hearing was held as the Treasury Department expanded its efforts to further isolate Syria by strengthening sanctions on Iranian airlines believed to be conducting the airlift under the guise of humanitarian aid. The Treasury Department, which oversees the sanctions, identified 117 Iranian aircraft on a list that will presumably press other countries, particularly Iraq, to prohibit them from flying through their airspace to Syria.“Iran has used deceptive measures when shipping such items to Syria,” the department said in a statement, “by using a combination of passenger and cargo flights and declaring illicit cargo as humanitarian and other licit goods.”The department also imposed new sanctions on a Syrian Army supply unit, a state-owned company in Belarus that makes bombs for the Syrian Army and the director of a Syrian research center that American officials said was responsible for developing unconventional weapons.Mr. Kerry is in a showdown with Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has been holding up ambassador nominations and other Senate business in an effort to get a Senate vote on withholding aid from Pakistan, Egypt and Libya unless they are more cooperative with the United States.Mr. Beecroft said that Iraq had been accepting Iran’s declarations that its planes were not carrying military equipment and had not been requiring that the planes land and be inspected.“They’re taking the manifests at face value,” he said. “We’re pressing them to have the aircraft — either disapprove the flights or have them land and be inspected, which is their right to do.”
