Insurers on New York State’s Health Exchange Seek Significant Rate Increases - The New York Times

Some New Yorkers are in sticker shock after receiving notices from their insurance companies saying that they have asked for significant rate increases through the state’s health exchange next year.The exchange, which has prided itself on being affordable, is now facing requests for increases as high as 28 percent for some customers of MetroPlus, a new entry to the individual insurance market and one of the least costly — and most popular — plans on the exchange this year.Beth Leibson, a Manhattan resident, received a letter from MetroPlus saying it was working on raising her rate by 28 percent. She said this was a higher one-year increase than any rate rise she had had with previous insurance, including insurance under the federal law known as Cobra, where she paid the entire bill. “It seems to me that this defeats the purpose of ‘affordable’ health insurance,” Ms. Leibson said.Over all, including plans inside or outside the exchange, insurance companies asked for average rate increases of 13 percent in 2015, the state’s Financial Services Department said Wednesday. The requests cover individual and small-group plans, but not large-group plans like those offered by large companies and government employers.State officials sought to play down the importance of the proposed rate increases, saying that they were only proposals and that they would probably be knocked down to some extent by state regulators, who have the final say.“We’re still in the process of reviewing it,” said Matt Anderson, a spokesman for the state financial services commissioner, Benjamin M. Lawsky. “The requests appear to be in line with prior years, which were subsequently reduced.”The rates do not account for any government subsidies, which Mr. Anderson said would also go up for some customers who qualify for them.In their proposals, the insurance companies justify their rate requests by citing the rising cost of medical care, aging demographics, high use of costly hospital services, and the fact that New York has one of the most expensive health care markets in the country.They also blame higher drug costs and a decline in federal aid that had been given to help with the transition to the health exchanges, which were created by the Affordable Care Act.Several insurers mentioned a new pool of customers and changes to the population they are serving through the exchange. State officials said that over all, the population on the exchange is healthier than it used to be on the individual market, but that there could be some part of that population that was sicker than expected or using more services than expected.“New York stands out as an especially costly state in which to purchase health care,” Empire BlueCross BlueShield said in documents supporting its rate proposal.A decision on the new rates is expected by the end of August.Last year, the state bragged that the average rates for even the richest plans New Yorkers could buy on the exchange in 2014 would cost 53 percent less than the coverage New Yorkers could buy on the individual market before the exchange was created.But in their requests for 2015, some of the exchange’s most popular companies are asking for double-digit rate increases. MetroPlus is asking for an average increase of 18.5 percent, including 28 percent for customers in its high-end Platinum plan. Empire HealthChoice H.M.O. is asking for an increase of 18 percent, and Health Republic, conceived by the Freelancers Union, is asking for a 15 percent average increase, including nearly 19 percent for some customers.Customers in the costlier plans are often the sickest and highest users of medical care.MetroPlus is run by New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city’s 11 public hospitals, whose mission is to serve the poor. It was formerly a Medicaid plan but expanded into the private market on the exchange in hopes of attracting a new, more middle-class clientele to the city hospital system.
