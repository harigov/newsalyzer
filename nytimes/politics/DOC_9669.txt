BRUSSELS — The monthly pilgrimage of the European Parliament from its headquarters in Brussels to its second seat in Strasbourg is producing 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year, equivalent to the greenhouse gases produced by 13,000 round-trip flights from London to New York, according to a study due for release Wednesday.The study, commissioned by the Parliament's Green group, shows that the commute to the legislature's monthly plenary session in Strasbourg  -    involving  3,000  staff members, officials, lobbyists, and journalists, as well as 15 truckloads of documents  -  produces emissions equivalent to the carbon dioxide produced annually by 4,000 London households, or by the entire population of the Turks and Caicos Islands in the West Indies.The report comes just weeks after the European Union committed itself to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by the year 2020.It will undermine the EU's efforts to take the moral high ground on climate change at a time when leading environmental officials have been pressing EU citizens to avoid unnecessary car travel to help reduce production of  greenhouse gases. Road transport    accounts for about one-fifth of the EU's total carbon dioxide emissions.The report, conducted by Professor John Whitelegg of the University of York, will also embolden already growing opposition to the Parliament's double  location in Brussels and Strasbourg, which costs EU taxpayers more than €200 million, or $270 million, a year and has become a symbol of the Union's waste and profligacy.Once a month on a Friday night, a convoy of 15 trucks containing 4,000 metallic trunks and cupboards filled with documents from the Parliament's headquarters in Brussels makes the 450-kilometer, or 280-mile, trip to Strasbourg.More than a million people from across the bloc recently signed a petition calling for the two-site arrangement to be scrapped."It is simply unacceptable that so much carbon dioxide is being emitted completely unnecessarily on this anachronistic traveling circus," said Caroline Lucas, the Green member of Parliament from southeast England, who commissioned the report."This study shows that the environmental costs of this unnecessary monthly merry-go-round are higher than those produced by some nations, including some of the very countries most at risk from rising sea levels caused by climate change."The European Parliament has a sprawling headquarters in Brussels, where it sits three weeks a month. But as a result of a 1992 treaty, the 785-member assembly has to hold sessions for four days a month in Strasbourg, a  French town on the German border.To reach Strasbourg,    which does not boast the same easy air and train connections as Brussels,   some members of  Parliament traveling  from Glasgow,   for example, have been known to drive two hours to Edinburgh, take a 90-minute flight to Frankfurt, and be picked up by a parliamentary minivan for a journey of  two more hours by road.A member  from Galway, in western Ireland, would have to drive an  hour to the nearest airport, take a 40-minute flight to Dublin, fly  to the Baden-Karlsruhe airport in Germany, and take a one-hour bus ride to Strasbourg.Added to the cost in  time is the cost of keeping up the Parliament's nine buildings in three cities:  Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg.  The upkeep  costs €206 million a year more than if the legislature were in one place, according to European Parliament officials monitoring the costs.Worse, these officials note, the Parliament's palatial glass headquarters in Strasbourg sits empty most of the year.The report estimates that the monthly Brussels-Strasbourg commute produces at least 20,268 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. That compares with  30,000 tons of carbon dioxide produced annually by the Pacific island nations of Kiribati and the Cook Islands.The study measured the extra total carbon emissions generated each month by members of Parliament, their staff, journalists and others who commute between Brussels and Strasbourg each month, as well as the environmental cost of the freight transported between the two locations and the energy needed to maintain the Parliament buildings.It concluded that scrapping the Strasbourg sessions would make 2,650 offices, a debating chamber and nearly 50 conference rooms unnecessary.
