OTTAWA — In a decision that will almost surely prompt showdowns with environmentalists, indigenous groups and some political allies, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada approved on Tuesday the expansion of a pipeline linking the oil sands in Alberta to a tanker port in British Columbia.The Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain project will increase the capacity of a 53-year-old pipeline to 890,000 barrels a day from 300,000 and expand the tanker port. In recent weeks, there have been several large protests against the project, particularly in Vancouver, British Columbia. But Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, has repeatedly said that the project is critical to the future of her province’s energy industry.Environmental groups began condemning the decision as Mr. Trudeau was making his announcement late Tuesday afternoon, but the prime minister said that the pipeline expansion did not contradict his pledges to improve environmental protection and mitigate climate change.“We’ve heard clearly from Canadians that they don’t want to see someone trying to make a choice between what’s good for the environment and what’s good for the economy,” Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference. “They need to go together, and the decisions we’ve made today and leading up to today are entirely consistent with that.”He said that spending much of his childhood with his grandparents in British Columbia and then studying and working in Vancouver as a teacher helped inform his decision on the pipeline.“If I thought that this project was unsafe for the B.C. coast, I would reject it,” he said.Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that he was “under no illusions” that his approval of the multibillion-dollar project would not encounter strong opposition. The expansion’s opponents include Gregor Robertson, the mayor of Vancouver, who is generally a political ally, and some members of Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal caucus in the House of Commons. But while Mr. Trudeau said the government welcomed people expressing contrary views, their opposition would not change what he characterized as a decision based on science.“We have not been and we will not be swayed by political arguments,” Mr. Trudeau said.A number of factors underlie opposition to the Kinder Morgan project. Some people in British Columbia fear that the increase in tanker traffic to the port in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby will inevitably lead to a major oil spill. Many environmentalists charge that the pipeline will make it impossible for Canada to meet the carbon emissions targets set by Mr. Trudeau’s government — an assertion the government rejects.And, like the protests that led the Obama administration to block the Keystone XL pipeline project from Canada, many people see blocking Kinder Morgan as a way to limit development of the oil sands, which they view as a particularly dirty energy source.Environmental groups said they would move to stop the project through a variety of means.“People are already standing up and fighting back, and that is only going to grow,” said Sven Biggs, the energy and climate campaigner for Stand.earth, an environmental group previously known as ForestEthics. “It’s going to be in the courts; it’s going to be in the streets; it’s also going to be at the ballot box.”Before Mr. Trudeau’s announcement, some opponents of the Kinder Morgan pipeline predicted that its approval would lead to protests on the scale of the anti-pipeline demonstrations now underway at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota.After a meeting on Monday with cabinet ministers in Ottawa about the pipeline, Chief Maureen Thomas of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, the indigenous community directly across from the tanker port in British Columbia, said in an interview that her community would mount a legal challenge if the project was approved.Court challenges by indigenous communities have previously stalled the Enbridge Northern Gateway, a pipeline plan to link the oil sands to the northern coast of British Columbia. On Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau said the government had told its energy board to reject that proposal.Rona Ambrose, the interim leader of the Conservative Party, criticized Mr. Trudeau for rejecting that pipeline. But she was also pessimistic about the prospects for the Kinder Morgan project in the face of legal challenges.“I don’t think that will have a chance of being built,” she told reporters.
