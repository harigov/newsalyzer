BRUSSELS — The European Union and Japan announced a broad agreement on Thursday that would lower barriers on virtually all the goods traded between them, a pointed challenge to President Trump on the eve of a summit meeting of world leaders in Germany.Though the deal still needs further negotiation and approval before it can take effect, it represents an act of geopolitical theater, a day before a Group of 20 summit meeting begins in Hamburg. At a meeting of G-20 finance ministers in March, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, pointedly declined to endorse a statement in favor of free trade.“Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said at a news conference in Brussels. “The world really doesn’t need to go a hundred years back in time. Quite the opposite.”Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said the deal signified the creation of “the world’s largest free, advanced, industrialized economic zone.”Here’s what you need to know about the deal:The core of the agreement aims to increase the flow of Japanese cars to Europe and of European food to Japan.The Europeans are expected to scrap a 10 percent tariff on passenger cars made in Japan, over a period of seven years. Duties would come down more rapidly for some car components.Those are key concessions: The Japanese automotive giants Toyota and Honda have claimed a smaller market share in Europe than in other major markets like the United States.Europe could still reimpose restrictions if there was a “very big increase as compared to normal” of imported Japanese cars, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told reporters later Thursday. She did not say, however, what specific level would cause that kind of reaction.The Japanese, in return, are expected to lower duties on European cheeses like Gouda from the Netherlands, while retaining their unusually complex regulations on dairy products.Tokyo is also likely to make it easier for European companies to bid for major government contracts, a move that could benefit train makers like Siemens of Germany and Alstom of France.Accompanying the trade deal is a separate partnership agreement in which both sides pledge greater cooperation on issues like cybercrime and climate protection.Negotiators have refused to include whaling and logging in the talks, which has angered environmental groups — Greenpeace has characterized the deal as “a huge transfer of power from people to big business.”Ms. Malmstrom responded this week by saying organizations like Greenpeace would be opposed to “any trade agreement,” ostensibly a criticism of the group’s stance against trade liberalization.On Wednesday, Ms. Malmstrom posed with the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, holding daruma dolls, a symbol of perseverance.Even without rules on whales and wood, the deal is the biggest bilateral trade agreement ever struck by the European Union, covering about a quarter of the global economy.Together, the European Union and Japan would constitute a trading bloc of a size to rival that created by the North American Free Trade Agreement, presently the world’s biggest free trade zone (and one that Mr. Trump wants to renegotiate).Not quite. The biggest issue that has not yet been agreed on is how to ensure that investors have a way to resolve disputes arising as a result of the deal.The Europeans want to employ a court system rather than ad hoc arbitration, which has been used for decades but has been heavily criticized by European lawmakers and environmental groups as being too soft on industry interests.The Japanese, however, argue that existing institutions are enough.European negotiators have also failed to persuade the Japanese to accept guarantees on freer flows of data. Both sides say they want to make progress on the issue by early next year.Negotiations have been proceeding for years, but were accelerated after Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a wide-ranging trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries that had Japan at its core.The new deal was a clear sign that other parts of the world will continue to pursue a liberalizing trade agenda, even without the United States.European and Japanese officials now expect the talks to be completed within months.In June, the Japanese Parliament passed a law that aims to address some of its dairy industry protections, which may make it easier to wrap up negotiations.The main concern, however, is the ratification process in Europe.A landmark trade deal with Canada nearly came unstuck last year when Wallonia, a region of Belgium, withheld its approval until its concerns were dealt with by the country’s political leaders.What would happen if the Walloons — or another region or country — were to balk this time? European officials did not have an answer to that this week.
