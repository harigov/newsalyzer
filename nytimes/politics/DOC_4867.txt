WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Friday reinstated regulations drawn up by the Obama administration to extend minimum wage and overtime protections to almost two million workers who provide home care for the elderly and disabled.The regulations, struck down by a lower court about nine months ago, were intended to remove an exemption in federal minimum wage and overtime laws for home care workers employed by third-party staffing agencies. A three-judge appellate panel in Washington ruled Friday that the Labor Department has the authority to eliminate the exemption.Labor law specialists, noting that Democratic administrations have been trying to eliminate the exemption since the early 1990s, called the ruling momentous. “It’s not that surprising, since it’s absolutely correct as a legal matter,” said Kate Andrias, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. “But it has an extremely important effect on the home care industry, home care workers, which is a lot of people.”Professor Andrias added that the ruling represented a major victory in the administration’s effort to revise labor regulations to reflect the economy today.Union leaders and advocates were also quick to embrace the decision. “This is an enormous step forward for home workers and for our country,” said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, which has pushed for the change for decades.The Labor Department created the exemption in 1975, while carrying out a law that Congress passed the year before. But the Obama administration argued that much had changed in the industry since the mid-1970s, when most patients received professional care in institutional settings, or received less-demanding care at home, known as “companionship” services, from workers they hired directly. Today, professional home care is widespread and is typically provided by employees of staffing agencies.Advocates and labor lawyers have long argued that Congress meant for all full-time care providers to be covered by the minimum wage and overtime provisions of federal labor law when it revised the law in 1974. The Labor Department made this argument when it issued the regulation in 2013, and on Friday the appellate panel, in the District of Columbia Circuit, agreed.“What the court recognized is that Congress intended this exemption to apply to people who do casual work, not people doing home care work as a full-time vocation or job,” said Peter Romer-Friedman, deputy director of litigation at the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.A lawyer for the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, one of the industry groups that challenged the new regulations, indicated that the plaintiff did not consider the fight over. “We’re reviewing the decision and considering all our options, including Supreme Court review,” said the lawyer, William A. Dombi of the Center for Health Care Law, which is backed by the home care and hospice industry.But the circuit court decision may be difficult to reverse. In its opinion, the court relied on a Supreme Court case from 2007 explicitly ruling that the 1974 law gives the Labor Department discretion over how to define the exemption, as long as the department’s interpretation is reasonable.The Supreme Court held that “Congress had granted authority to the department to resolve the issue,” the circuit court wrote in its opinion Friday. It also said that the Labor Department interpretation in question was reasonable.Instead of appealing directly to the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs could also file a motion with the District of Columbia Circuit for a so-called rehearing en banc, which would involve all of its active judges rather than simply a three-judge panel. But the circuit rarely grants such motions, and the unanimous ruling by the panel, which included one Republican appointee and two Democratic appointees, suggests that the full court would be unlikely to reverse it, legal specialists said.While the decision does not directly affect the status of other administration regulations that are likely to face litigation — most prominently its recent proposed expansion of overtime benefits to millions of workers by narrowing exemptions to the law — it suggests that the legal basis for such regulations is sound.Mr. Romer-Friedman, a former labor counsel to Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said the opinion showed that the Labor Department, “when interpreting statutory provisions not specifically defined” by the Fair Labor Standards Act, “has a lot of discretion and authority.”If anything, he said, the courts are more likely to uphold the proposed overtime rule than the Labor Department’s home care worker regulation, because the department has been issuing similar changes in the overtime exemption for professional, managerial and administrative employees for decades, whereas in this case the major previous rule cut in the opposite direction.But more important than the narrow legal implications for other Labor Department regulations may be the way that politics and the law interact on such questions.“For the department’s authority to interpret its own statutes to be affirmed in a highly contested case that’s one piece of a series of important moves it has made to benefit low wage workers is a big victory,” Professor Andrias said. “Politics matter a lot. Both this rule and the overtime rule are staunchly opposed by industry. That can affect the way the courts understand legal issues.”
