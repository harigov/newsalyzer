MEXICO CITY — At least one of 43 students missing since September has been identified among remains largely burned to ashes, family members and a federal official said Saturday, adding considerable weight to a theory by prosecutors that the students were killed after being abducted by municipal police and turned over to a drug gang.The federal attorney general’s office scheduled a news conference Sunday to announce the discovery, which has yet to be declared officially. However, an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one set of remains matched a student, and family members of other students said they were told the same at a late-night meeting Friday with Argentine forensic investigators assisting the Mexican government with the case.The plight of the students has shaken the country for weeks and exposed the deep links between many local officials and organized-crime gangs. The case has helped push President Enrique Peña Nieto’s approval ratings to the lowest of his two-year tenure — the lowest of any Mexican president in nearly two decades. The pressure has forced him to make security and policing a top priority over the economic moves he has favored.Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam had said on Nov. 7 that some gang members in custody had described in detail the abduction of the students from a rural teachers college in southwest Mexico after a protest in the town of Iguala. Those witnesses said the police, infiltrated by gang members and working at the behest of a mayor with gang ties, turned over the students to the gang, which killed them and burned their remains in a garbage dump. The remains were then placed in garbage bags and tossed into and along the banks of a river.But family members had insisted authorities continue the search, in the hope that the students could be alive, and tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in a series of marches across the country — including one Saturday in Mexico City — and some cities abroad with demands to resolve the case and fix a Mexico that they feel is riddled with corruption and organized-crime violence.The news of the identification of the student came as a shock to family members, who have maintained a vigil at the school in Ayotzinapa, Mexico, an hour’s drive from Acapulco, and have expressed deep mistrust of the authorities and the way they have been conducting the investigation. Families have clung to hope as well as occasional rumors of the students’ being held alive in a cave, a warehouse or in the hills, with only a few accepting the prospect of their deaths.“Imagine how we feel, we have kept the hope that they were alive, and then this announcement came,” Ernestina Jacinto, the mother of Israel Jacinto, 19, one of the missing students, said in a soft, exhausted voice.“What hurts the most is that they were so young, and they did not deserve the death they got,” she said, adding that she did not have the strength to attend Saturday’s march in Mexico City as she absorbed the news. “No mother can imagine her own son is dead.”She said members of the Argentine forensic team, who could not be reached for comment, told the families that it may be difficult to make further identifications because the remains, reduced to ash and bone fragments, are in a condition that challenged even the high-tech laboratory at the University of Innsbruck in Austria that analyzed them and has a reputation for handling the most difficult cases.Speaking after a mass march on Saturday in Mexico City, Felipe de la Cruz, the father of a missing student and a spokesman for the families, said the student was Alexander Mora, as other family members also said they were told.“We won’t cry for you Alexander,” he told thousands gathered at the monument to the revolution in the heart of the city. “Your downfall will flourish in the revolution. Know wherever you are that we are going to do justice.”He said the families would continue to press for a search for the other students until all are confirmed dead or found alive.Animal Politico, a news site, said Mr. Mora was 19 years old and longed to be a teacher, according to his father.“Nobody could take that idea from him,” the news site quoted his father as saying. “We are farmers, and he would help us in the fields, but he wanted to study.”The case of the missing students, who attended a college steeped in leftist political thought and given to rowdy, disruptive protests, has already led to the resignation of the governor of the state where it occurred, Guerrero, and to the arrest of dozens of people, including the mayor of Iguala and his wife.The authorities have said the mayor prompted the abduction by ordering the police to round up the students before they could disrupt a speech his politically aspiring wife was giving. The students had gone to Iguala to steal buses for transportation to a coming demonstration, a common practice of theirs that has perplexed and sometimes angered officials.Mr. Peña Nieto last week unveiled a series of proposals that would essentially do away with most municipal police in Mexico and turn over public safety to larger state police departments, though several analysts have said the moves did not go far enough and sidestepped other changes in the judicial system that could confront the lawlessness evident in many pockets of the country.
