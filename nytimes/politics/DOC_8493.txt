WASHINGTON — The Senate passed several provisions to bolster security throughout the nation’s transportation system Thursday, the first legislative response to the attacks on the airport and train station in Belgium last month.The measures, which are expected to pass as early as next week, are attached to a large-scale bill to reauthorize funding for the Federal Aviation Administration.The measures strengthen airport employee vetting, increase the use of teams that conduct covert operations to test security systems and could double the number of visible special security teams that are used to deter threats.They also enhance security around airport perimeters, fund law enforcement training for dealing with active shooters and require the Transportation Security Administration to review potential insider threats posed by employees. Some experts believe a recent attack on a Russian flight leaving Egypt had help from an aviation worker.The government would also expand the T.S.A. PreCheck program, which lawmaker said would both decrease wait times for passengers and give agents better opportunities to screen other passengers.Added to the broader bipartisan bill, which gives the Federal Aviation Administration new mandates to increase cybersecurity protections and a review of cockpit barriers, the overall bill broadly addresses the fears — if not the vast majority of infuriating inconveniences — of the American flying public.“Events around the world and security lapses at U.S. airports necessitate new protections for the traveling public,” said Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “Keeping Americans safe from future attacks is a top priority in this Senate.”The bombings at the Brussels airport and at a subway station last month killed scores of travelers and injured hundreds of others, inciting nations around the world to enhance security measures at travel hubs.“The security of passengers and crew remains our highest priority,” said Vaughn Jennings, a managing director at Airline for America, a trade organization representing airline companies. “We are in the safest period in aviation history due to the ongoing and strong collaboration among the airlines, airports, labor, manufacturers and government.”The Senate reauthorization bill, which would finance the F.A.A. through September 2017, also contains a number of provisions to help consumers, though far fewer than Democrats and consumer groups craved.For instance, the bill requires airlines to provide families with information about the availability of seats together at the time of booking, create a standard method for disclosing its fees on baggage and seat selection and to return baggage fees when luggage is lost or delayed.There is also a provision that would require an airline to make an automatic refund to passengers who did not receive benefits they paid for, like a preferred seat or early boarding. Passengers would also have a right to a review of whether airlines fairly attribute delays or cancellations to weather when there may be other factors involved.But a measure desperately sought by travelers’ groups — one that would have forced airlines to stop the legroom shrink in seats and advertise current legroom on their websites — went down, even after its author, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, gave an impassioned speech in its favor on the Senate floor and lobbied tall senators to support it.“Moms with kids have a lot of trouble in these very narrow seats,” he said, also mentioning the middle seat dilemma of being wedged between two large people. The industry opposed it, as did tall Republicans, and so the measure failed, 42 to 54.“I don’t think that we ought to be regulating people,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who stands over six feet tall and was the subject of Mr. Schumer’s pleas. Though he added wistfully, “I like how it would benefit me.”The bill also maintains special funding for airports in rural areas, known as the Essential Air Service Program and the Small Community Air Service Development Program, which some conservative senators have railed against as a needless giveaway.One House measure never made it to the floor after leaders scrapped it because it included a provision to privatize the nation’s air traffic control system. “There is no basis for the chatter coming from some in the House that hearts and minds are going to be changed down here on air traffic control privatization,” said Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. “Not gonna happen.”Should the Senate bill pass this month, the House will have to decide whether to simply take it up, pass it and send it to Mr. Obama to sign or try and create its own version.“The F.A.A. reauthorization act has been a bipartisan effort from the very start,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who has been eager to get bipartisan bills passed on the floor this spring.Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, agreed but used the bill’s momentum to draw contrasts between the parties. Mr. Reid said that Democrats were behaving as a “responsible minority.”
