Shenan Chuang is the chief executive officer of Ogilvy & Mather, Greater China. She manages 2,400 employees and in 2010 was named among “Top 25 Business Women in China” by Fortune China magazine.“In my business I can see a lot of women, far more than 20 years ago,” the Taiwan-born Ms. Chuang, left, said by telephone from Taipei.“I think the opportunities for women in this part of the world are enormous,” she said. “I have never felt the gender issue in my career. In our business, communications and creative, it’s more a question of personal talent.”Yet marriage is a game-changer for Chinese women, says Ms. Chuang, who is single. “Women I meet in my business tend to be quite aggressive and independent before they get married,” she said. “I think marriage is always a milestone for women in their real life journey, and a lot of women think maybe they should go back to their families and real life, rather than be a company executive.”Compared to mainland China, in Taiwan, “the market is more mature and there are more female leaders — one of our candidates for president was a woman!” she said, referring to Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s first female presidential candidate, who ran for the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party in January, losing to Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang.“From the global and Greater China perspective, in the political area, I think women face a lot of challenges and also a lot of opposition,” she said.Can she see a woman as president in the Chinese-speaking world? “It would be a good breakthrough,” she said.
