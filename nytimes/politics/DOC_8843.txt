SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt —  American military officials said Tuesday that satellite surveillance had detected a large flash of light just as a Russian chartered jet broke apart and fell from the sky over the Sinai Peninsula on Saturday, killing all 224 people aboard.The United States military is not part of the multinational investigation into the crash, but officials said the satellite images were the first indication that the plane had exploded, because of either a bomb or the ignition of a fuel tank. But it will probably take several more days for the authorities to better understand what occurred.The disaster has set off waves of hand-wringing in Egypt, Russia and elsewhere about whether mechanical failure, human error or terrorism was the cause. But here in the resort area where the plane took off minutes before the crash, thousands of sun-seekers from Russia and other European countries arriving daily say they are undeterred. Most have already written off the possibility that the crash was terrorism.They shrug off the risks, exhale cigarette smoke and talk about destiny.“Russia is dangerous and not safe either,” said Svetlana Golobitz, a pediatrician from St. Petersburg sucking on a cigarette just outside the terminal gate. “You can have an accident driving in a car or walking in the night; this is your fate,” she said. “I like this place, so I want to spend my winter here.”The Russian and Egyptian authorities have both sought to rule out an act of terrorism even as they have warned others against premature speculation about the results of their continuing investigation.President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt on Tuesday dismissed claims of responsibility by a branch of the Islamic State as “propaganda” aiming to harm “the stability and security of Egypt and the image of Egypt.” But in the same interview with the BBC, Mr. Sisi also said that it would “take time to clarify” the causes of the crash because the investigation was just beginning.The Russian news agency Interfax published details on Tuesday about what it said were recordings of the crew’s conversations that showed all was normal four minutes before the plane disappeared from radar screens.“The crew was engaged in routine communications with air traffic controllers,” the news agency said, attributing the details to an unnamed source in Cairo. “Sounds uncharacteristic of a standard flight precede the moment of the airliner’s disappearance from radar screens,” the agency said, quoting the source.“The recordings suggest that an emergency situation occurred on board unexpectedly, took the crew by surprise, and the pilots had no time to send out a distress signal,” Interfax said.The crash took place Saturday over an area of the Sinai Peninsula where Egyptian security forces are battling local militants affiliated with the Islamic State. But the plane was flying at an altitude too high for the militants to strike with the kinds of missiles they are believed to possess. The report of the images seems to bolster the conclusion that a missile attack was unlikely.The midair breakup of the plane scattered debris across eight square miles, according to Russian and Egyptian officials, and most of the dead were Russians.Russian officials said Tuesday that remains, including the bodies of 140, had arrived in St. Petersburg, according to Interfax. Nine of the bodies have been identified, officials said.Five countries have sent representatives to join an investigative team working in Cairo, and the team is preparing to analyze the so-called black-box recordings of the flight’s data. But the investigators have not yet released any details of what they may have uncovered.A senior American law enforcement official said the flash detected by a military satellite “could have been caused by any number of things,” including a bomb, an exploding fuel tank or some other cause. Some in Russia say that news of the crash has turned them off Sharm el Sheikh, a perennial favorite destination. Tatyana Utkina, 32, had planned to leave Moscow on Wednesday for a two-week vacation for her family of four, but she canceled the trip. “We don’t plan to go to Egypt for a while at least,” she said.She said she suspected terrorism had brought down the plane, despite the lack of evidence, noting that the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility had called the crash retribution for Russia’s recent airstrikes against militants in Syria. “What happened is connected to what is happening in Syria,” she said.Russian travel agents said the crash had chilled the demand for air travel to almost any destination, not just to Egypt. “Yesterday there was a moment when no tours were sold at all,” said Irina Tyurina, the spokeswoman for the Russian Union of Tour Operators.But when the third direct flight of the day from Moscow landed at Sharm el Sheikh around 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, hundreds of new Russian tourists came pouring out of the airport, squinting in the glare of the late afternoon sun as they raced their wheeled suitcases toward five waiting tour buses.In interviews, dozens of tourists from Russia, Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark said that, while saddened by the crash, they were still delighted with their own travel plans.Kelly Thomas, 41, and Robert Flinn, 48, said they first learned of the crash on Saturday morning when they were sipping Champagne in a lounge at Gatwick Airport, outside London, waiting to take off on a British charter flight. “I thought, ‘Oh my God,’ ” recalled Ms. Thomas, a nervous traveler in the best of circumstances.She considered that it was a Russian airline, she recalled, sitting at the bar of the mostly-full Sharm el Sheikh Hard Rock Cafe on Tuesday evening, before her return flight. “I don’t mean to be derogatory of the Russians, but they are the worst when it comes to flight safety.”As for the Islamic State’s claim, Mr. Flinn said he expected it, regardless of the cause. “They want to look as scary as possible.”By twilight, the Naama Bay promenade, an avenue of tourist shops and restaurants with the Hard Rock Cafe on one side and a Buddha Bar on the other, was just beginning to fill up as tourists filtered in from the surrounding beaches and scuba diving spots. By 8:30 p.m., the outdoor restaurants and nightclubs in the upscale Soho Square development were so thick with tourists that walking was difficult in places, and buses from the surrounding resorts were just beginning to ferry in crowds for a long night ahead.Most of the cars on the streets were taxicabs and police vehicles. Some patrol cars circled the main road with their lights silently flashing, and unmarked white Toyota station wagons filled with uniformed police officers patrolled as well.The tourists interviewed here described a feeling of security inside the city and its resorts. Natalie Galloway, 38, and her daughter, Meghan, 17, said they had been coming every year for eight years from Buckingham, near Oxford. During the upheaval after the military takeover two years ago, their hotel advised them to stay in for the night. But after that everything went back to normal.“Everywhere you go, there are roadblocks or police everywhere, and it makes you feel reassured,” Natalie said.Hisham Zaazou, the minister of tourism, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that he foresaw a possible “short-term” dip in the number of Russian visitors because of the crash, until the possibility of terrorism was fully ruled out. “That is why I am crossing my fingers that the result of the investigation will be a technical failure, which will be a positive for Egypt,” he said.The Russians were the quickest to dismiss the possibility of terrorism, said a local tour operator who gave his name only as Safy, 25, mainly because they had the strongest conviction about their own government’s negligence. “All the Russians say, ‘This is our country’s fault,’ ” he said.
