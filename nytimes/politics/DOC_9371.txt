New Cholesterol Drugs Are Vastly Overpriced, Analysis Says - The New York Times

Two powerful new drugs that can sharply lower cholesterol are vastly overpriced based on the value they provide, according to a new analysis by an independent organization that evaluates pharmaceutical costs.The analysis, released on Tuesday, said that measured by the health benefits the drugs provide, the price should be only about one-third the level set by the manufacturers. The cost should be even lower — about 15 percent of list price — to avoid straining health care budgets, it said.The new report is from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit organization that made a name for itself last year when it warned about the costs of new drugs to treat hepatitis C.Health plans use the group’s reports, and this new one could increase pressure on the makers of the cholesterol drugs to offer bigger discounts. Express Scripts, the country’s largest pharmaceutical benefit manager, has said it plans to use the report’s findings in its negotiations with the drug companies.The two drugs, Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the last two months. In clinical trials they lowered the level of LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad kind, by 40 percent or more, even when patients were already taking statins.But the drugs’ prices — $14,100 a year for Repatha and $14,600 a year for Praluent — have raised concern about costs, especially since the drugs might be used year after year by millions of Americans.“Even if these drugs were used in just over 25 percent of eligible patients, then employers, insurers and patients would need to spend on average more than $20 billion a year,” Dr. Steven D. Pearson, the founder and president of ICER, said in a statement.The analysis said the drugs should cost $3,615 to $4,811 a year, based on the value they are expected to provide in terms of preventing heart attacks and deaths.The drugs should cost even less — $2,177 — the analysis said, to be at a level where health plans would not have to limit their use to prevent straining health care budgets.ICER’s report is expected to be the first of many, from different organizations and academic researchers, to assess the cost-effectiveness of the cholesterol drugs, and some may reach different conclusions since much depends on the assumptions used. ICER termed its report a draft that would be open to public comment and discussed at a meeting in Boston on Oct. 27.Amgen said in a statement on Tuesday that while it welcomed a “balanced discussion of value,” it disagreed with ICER’s methodology, assumptions and preliminary conclusions, which it noted had not undergone public comment or formal peer review.“We are concerned that ICER’s review does not place value on addressing a significant unmet medical need,” the statement said, “and its short-term budgetary focus will be used to create access barriers to innovative medicines like Repatha for appropriate patients.”Regeneron said it had not had adequate time to review ICER’s report. But a spokeswoman said, “These calculations are complex, and a robust and open peer-review process is essential.”One big potential problem with the analysis is that it is not known whether the drugs prevent heart attacks, strokes or death, and if they do, by how much. Large clinical trials aimed at answering those questions are expected to have results around 2017.But ICER estimated the potential benefits on the basis of an amalgamation of results from smaller trials and on the level of cholesterol reduction achieved by the drugs. It said that use of the drugs might reduce mortality from all causes by about 50 percent.The organization applied those benefits to a computer simulation of the adult American population, tallying up the costs of the drugs as well as potential cost savings, such as those from reduced hospitalizations for heart attacks.It estimated that use of the drugs would prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, heart attacks or strokes over the next 20 years, but at a cost exceeding $500,000 for each additional “quality-adjusted life-year.”That is a measure used by health economists, in which a year of life in perfect health is one quality-adjusted life-year, while a year in less than good health is some fraction of a life-year.Health care economists use different thresholds for determining when a procedure or drug is cost-effective. Some say less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year; others say less than $100,000 or less than $150,000. To get to the $150,000 level, the cholesterol drugs would have to cost $4,811 a year, and to get to $100,000, they would have to cost $3,615, according to the analysis.Dr. Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer of CVS Health, a pharmacy benefit manager, said ICER’s conclusions were “basically right in line with our view of the medications — that they have some value, but at their current prices they are way overpriced.”
