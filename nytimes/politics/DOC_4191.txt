Following is immediate real-time analysis of the seventh Republican debate. Read additional fact checks here.The question of what a Republican debate might look like without Donald J. Trump has loomed over the first six contests. It will be answered when the candidates take the stage on Thursday at 9 p.m. Eastern time. We asked New York Times political reporters what they would be looking for in a Trumpless forum, the last debate before Monday’s Iowa caucuses.This close to an election, debates inevitably become forums for the trailing candidates to attack those at the top of the polls. There are two candidates who are likely to come under the most fire.I’ll be curious to see who will take the brunt of the attacks, Ted Cruz or Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz can be expected to target Mr. Trump, regardless of whether he is present. But which of the two leaders in Iowa the rest of the field chooses to focus on could go a long way in telling us who they think is in the stronger position going into the final weekend before Iowa.— Jonathan Martin _____Mr. Trump will not be the only target of Republicans who is not on the debate stage on Thursday. All of the candidates will be auditioning to prove that they are best suited to take on Hillary Clinton.The last thing she needs four days before the caucuses is a stage full of Republicans criticizing her and drawing unfavorable contrasts for Democrats and independents. On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton joked that being targeted by Republicans was “perversely flattering.”— Amy Chozick_____Mr. Cruz took on all comers as a college-debate champion. But can he outfox an invisible man? If Mr. Trump goes through with his pledge to skip the debate, look for Mr. Cruz to make the evening a referendum on his choice, making the case again and again that Mr. Trump has shown disrespect to the Iowans whose votes he is seeking.— Matt Flegenheimer_____I will be paying close attention to a man on the stage who is not known for his debating skills: Jeb Bush. If Mr. Bush hopes to get a second look from voters (in Iowa but also New Hampshire), he could use a breakout moment.Mr. Bush has shown that he is comfortable attacking Mr. Trump, but if the billionaire businessman boycotts the debate, as promised, it is unclear whether Mr. Bush will be as comfortable, or capable, of delivering a blow to his other rivals.— Ashley Parker_____Trump or no Trump, the focus will be as much on the Fox News moderators as it will be on the candidates. With the accusations flung from the Trump campaign, viewers, if not candidates, will be parsing the questions, hunting for glimmers of bias. With this in mind, expect the moderators — Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace — to be exceptionally prepared and direct in their questioning.— Nick Corasaniti_____In the absence of Mr. Trump onstage, who can carry his mantle of devil-may-care straight talk? In truth, probably no one. But the best shot belongs to Chris Christie and Mr. Cruz. Watch for them to try, perhaps too hard, to own the night.— Michael Barbaro_____If Mr. Trump’s presence sucked the air out of past debates, what will fill the vacuum this time? Look for the candidates seeking to appeal to establishment-aligned voters to make attacks that echo the ads the “super PACs” supporting them are placing on the airwaves: Marco Rubio on Mr. Bush, Mr. Bush on Mr. Christie, John R. Kasich on Mr. Rubio, and every variation in between.— Nicholas Confessore_____Can Ben Carson make an impression? He has yet to accomplish that feat in the Republican debates. But with his candidacy hinging on a strong showing in Iowa, this could be his last chance to make his pitch to a large number of voters. The retired neurosurgeon has been studying tax policy, cybersecurity and foreign policy. Thursday night may be his final opportunity to put that knowledge on display.— Alan Rappeport_____Asked on Wednesday night what he thought the effect of Mr. Trump’s absence would be, Mr. Kasich — not a standout performer in the debates so far — gave a simple answer: “Probably more time for all of us.”Mr. Kasich is counting on a strong showing in New Hampshire to catapult his candidacy into the spotlight, so how he uses that time will matter. Will the candidate, whose calm demeanor has kept him from rising above the sharp tone of previous face-offs, have a better chance of being heard without Mr. Trump onstage?— Thomas Kaplan_____Does Mr. Kasich still get a free pass?The Ohio governor has drawn scant criticism from his opponents so far, with the occasional exception of Mr. Trump. But Mr. Kasich’s polling numbers have risen lately in New Hampshire, where he has insistently wooed more moderate Republican voters. With a tight race there among the establishment-friendly candidates, rivals like Mr. Christie and Mr. Rubio may not allow Mr. Kasich to deliver his message again unchallenged.— Alexander Burns_____With Mr. Trump’s absence, Mr. Rubio could become the punching bag who fills the void. Mr. Cruz, Mr. Christie and Mr. Bush have all attacked the Florida senator in previous debates. (He has also been the subject of more than $20 million in attack ads.) Not that Mr. Rubio won’t be looking to get in a few swings himself. But expect most of his attacks to be focused on Mr. Cruz. If Mr. Cruz wins Iowa, Mr. Rubio’s path to the nomination gets much harder.— Jeremy W. Peters_____Mr. Cruz, a champion debater at Princeton and Harvard, may find himself in a familiar position Thursday, spending much of the contest defending himself from attacks from the other contenders now that Mr. Trump, his chief rival, has made other plans. In college, Mr. Cruz was known as a great speaker more than fast-on-his-feet debater, so it will be interesting to see how the highly prepared and intellectually gifted politician handles unexpected and unrelenting challenges.— Jason Horowitz_____I’ll be watching for how aggressively Mr. Bush goes after Mr. Christie and Mr. Rubio. Mr. Bush has focused hard on proving he could take on Mr. Trump in the last few debates, but realistically Mr. Christie and Mr. Rubio are his real targets.I also wonder if he will attack Mr. Kasich, as his super PAC has been doing. Mr. Kasich is rising in recent polls in New Hampshire, and Mr. Bush could really benefit from creating a moment.— Maggie Haberman
