ALBUQUERQUE — Once an integral part of the Republican Party’s rise to power under Gov. Susana Martinez’s stewardship in this Democratic stronghold, the secretary of state, Dianna Duran, has now been abandoned by her party, threatened with impeachment by her political opponents and called on to resign by one of the state’s leading newspapers.Ms. Duran is facing 64 misdemeanor and felony charges,  accused of misusing campaign money to cover gambling and other personal expenses, one of several scandals to have rocked New Mexico politics this summer.For Democrats, Ms. Duran’s fall from grace caps a string of scandals that have offered a chance to regain lost ground ahead of next year’s elections. They include the hiring of a man accused of child sexual assault as deputy schools superintendent in Albuquerque and an investigation over potential abuse of power by a senior state executive.The goal, Democratic Party leaders said, is to taint the narrative of Ms. Martinez, the nation’s first female Hispanic governor, as a tough-on-crime leader who campaigned on cleaning up politics and is often mentioned as a potential vice-presidential candidate for a party struggling to improve its image with Hispanic voters.Though she must leave office at the beginning of 2019 because she is limited to two consecutive terms, Ms. Martinez has drawn votes from both sides of the aisle and helped her party make significant gains. She will lead the Republican Governors Association in November, elevating her profile just as presidential politics heat up. State Democrats are concerned that her popularity will help Republican candidates, even if she is not on the ballot.“The governor should step up and face the serious cases of corruption that have occurred under her watch,” said the state’s Democratic Party chairwoman, Deb Haaland, although none of the recent cases have been proved in court. “Each time the governor slings mud in the face of real issues, she loses credibility. New Mexicans deserve better.”Republican officials dismissed the Democrats’ attacks as a desperate attempt from a party struggling to retain its relevance. “Unlike her political opponents, Governor Martinez respects the intelligence of New Mexicans and understands that they see through baseless attacks,” said her spokesman, Chris Sanchez.Democrats lost their majority in the House of Representatives last year for the first time since 1954, a defeat attributed to a well-liked Republican governor, a national environment favorable to conservative politics and dismal turnout. They maintain a 24-to-18 majority in the Senate, though its seats were not at play in the last elections, as they will be in 2016.“If they now choose to make this election about ethics,” said Pat Garrett, spokesman for the state’s Republican Party, “we welcome the opportunity.”New Mexico has weathered its share of scandals. A former State Senate leader served time for taking kickbacks while in office, two former state treasurers were imprisoned for pocketing taxpayers’ money, and a former secretary of state was indicted on charges of fraud and money-laundering. They were all Democrats.Time and again, the governor and her close advisers have pointed to investments made during the administration of her Democratic predecessor, Bill Richardson, as evidence that Democrats cannot be trusted to run the state. More recently, they have taken aim at the Democratic state auditor, Tim Keller, questioning his use of a private email account after taking office, a practice in which Ms. Martinez and top officials in her administration also engaged in the past.In 2012, Ms. Martinez signed legislation allowing judges to strip officials convicted of corruption from their government pensions, then cited the accomplishment in fliers mailed to voters during her re-election campaign. She has called the allegations against Ms. Duran “deeply troubling” and said, “It’s important that New Mexicans understand that no one is above the law and that every New Mexican is treated equally under our system.”Political analysts here say, however, that if there is a threat to the unfolding turmoil, it is exactly to the prevailing narrative of her administration — and, by association, state Republicans — as agents of change.“It runs against their overall theme of cleaning up politics in New Mexico, and that can easily become a liability in 2016,” said Joe Monahan, whose daily blog is one of the state’s most closely read political journals.Brian Sanderoff, a pollster here, said that tying all the recent scandals to the governor “is a stretch at this point,” but that creating the “perception of blame” may not be as difficult a task.It is unlikely that any of her home state’s current troubles will have been resolved or forgotten anytime soon.Ms. Duran’s first court appearance is next Tuesday. A criminal complaint filed Aug. 28 by the Democratic attorney general, Hector Balderas, alleged $13,000 in illegal transactions, including campaign checks deposited into her personal bank account, from which she withdrew $282,000 at eight Indian casinos in the state in 2014 — more than three times her annual salary of $85,000.In an email, Ms. Duran’s lawyer, Erlinda O. Johnson, called the charges “sensational and misleading” and pledged to “vigorously fight this selective prosecution” by Mr. Balderas, one of the Democrats’ top picks for the governor’s race.The other is Mr. Keller, the state auditor. Early this year, he hired a forensic accounting firm to look into an anonymous complaint received by his office alleging that Demesia Padilla, Ms. Martinez’s appointee as secretary of taxation and revenue, had used her position to pressure employees to give preferential treatment to a taxpayer for whom she had worked as a private accountant.In July, Mr. Keller referred the findings to Mr. Balderas, who is reviewing whether they warrant criminal or ethical charges. In response, Mr. Sanchez, the governor’s spokesman, called Mr. Keller a “highly partisan state auditor” with “a history of playing fast and loose with the facts in order to see his name in the paper.”In an interview, Mr. Keller said, “Their attitude is to shoot the messenger” — a pattern used against anyone who dares criticize her administration, he said. “I’m fulfilling the obligations of my job.”He and Mr. Balderas also sent letters to Albuquerque Public Schools officials — Mr. Keller raising concerns about complaints by the schools’ chief financial officer over the merits of certain contracts and Mr. Balderas bringing up flawed safety protocols that allowed the man facing child sexual assault charges, Jason Martinez, to get a job in the largest public school system in the state.Mr. Martinez (no relation to the governor) had not submitted to a background check before his hiring. His legal troubles escaped notice until NM Political Report, an online publication, broke the news Aug. 21. He had resigned a day earlier.The schools’ chief financial officer, Don Moya, filed a whistle-blower lawsuit Aug. 24, alleging that the governor and the state’s education secretary, Hanna Skandera, had had a hand in hiring Mr. Martinez. Earlier, Mr. Moya had received a text message that Luis Valentino, then the superintendent, had apparently meant to send to Ms. Skandera, saying that he planned to “go after” Mr. Moya and asking whether she had “any ideas.” Mr. Moya was placed on leave shortly after receiving the message.Mr. Garrett, of the state Republican Party, said the blame for Mr. Martinez’s hiring should fall on “the Democratic-dominated school board” and Mr. Valentino, “the San Francisco liberal they appointed as superintendent.”Mr. Valentino resigned Aug. 31. Two days later, House Speaker Don Tripp, a Republican, formed a committee to assess the possibility of impeaching the secretary of state, who had not heeded calls to leave the job.
