With senators eager to wrap up their pre-election business, the Senate is set on Monday to take the first step toward approving a stopgap spending bill by the end of the week.A scheduled procedural vote would begin the process of advancing a continuing resolution to keep the government funded — and open — until early December, allowing senators to return home to campaign in what is a very close fight for control of the Senate next year.The Senate was supposed to begin moving ahead last week, but a variety of contentious issues led by the lingering dispute over funding to combat the Zika virus delayed the vote to allow more negotiations. Other disputes also remain, including a proposal to restore operations at the Export-Import Bank, flood relief for Louisiana and aid for Flint, Mich., because of its water contamination issues. Negotiators trying to work those out will need to make progress before Monday’s vote.Despite the differences, the desire to get out of town can be a powerful incentive, with lawmakers on both sides acutely aware that the battle for the Senate could turn on a handful of races. The House is expected to consider the spending plan after the Senate acts, but it will face considerable pressure to approve it since the Senate is likely to have taken its leave by the time the House has its say.
