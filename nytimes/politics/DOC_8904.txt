What made Terry Strada fall fast in love with her husband, Thomas, when they met 20 years ago? "Oh my God, he was the most fun person I ever knew," Mrs. Strada said. "He would take me out, and the sky was the limit. Limos, dinners. I said I liked the Boston Celtics; he flew me to Boston to see them."Three months after Mr. Strada's death, his wife is still inundated with calls from people eager to reminisce about thrills they experienced, courtesy of Thomas Strada."If they went fishing with him, it was the best fishing trip they ever had," Mrs. Strada said. "If they went to the track with him and he won money, he'd share it and make everyone a winner for the night."Mr. Strada, 41, a bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, also ensured that his son, Thomas, 7, and daughter, Kaitlyn, 4, experienced as much exhilaration as they could handle. The family visited Disney World three times since Tommy was born. Just 10 days before his death, Mr. Strada helped the boy catch his first bass.There is one family member, however, who has missed out on the joy of life with Mr. Strada. He is Justin Thomas, Mr. Strada's third child. He was just four days old on Sept. 11.These sketches were written by Carla Baranauckas, Dan Barry, Celestine Bohlen, Michael Brick, Glenn Collins, Sherri Day, Anthony DePalma, Jonathan D.
