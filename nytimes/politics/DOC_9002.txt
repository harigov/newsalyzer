RIO DE JANEIRO — The skies opened on Sunday night over Maracanã, the stadium where Brazil bade farewell to the Rio Olympics with a spectacle celebrating everything from the giants of Brazilian music to the rock art drawn by tribesmen thousands of years ago, as if the heavens were lamenting the end of the 17-day sports extravaganza.Still, the rainfall at the closing ceremony had little effect on the spirits of the performers who praised towering creative figures and thinkers like the prolific composer Heitor Villa-Lobos; the landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx; and Niède Guidon, the archaeologist whose discoveries in the remote caves of northeast Brazil are challenging long-held beliefs about the peopling of the Americas.Nodding to Brazil’s diversity as Latin America’s largest country, the ceremony also honored facets of an astonishingly rich musical heritage that are often overlooked, promoting As Ganhadeiras de Itapuã, a group of former washerwomen rescuing Afro-Brazilian songs in northeast Brazil, as well as Arnaldo Antunes, a poet and vocalist who once sang for Titãs, a pioneering São Paulo rock band.The Carnivalesque ceremony, featuring frevo dancers twirling umbrellas, a performance by the samba legend Martinho da Vila and the songs of Carmen Miranda, offered a folkloric if fittingly upbeat bookend to an Olympiad that had been shrouded in grim assessments and protests as the Games approached.Despite widespread fears that the city would be unprepared, or that crime and disorganization might turn the Olympics into a national embarrassment, many Brazilians came to view the Games as a triumph and a much-needed distraction from the country’s economic malaise and political upheaval.In the days after the opening ceremony, the criticisms that the Games were an inappropriate use of public money at a time of crisis were mostly subsumed by a sense that Brazil had largely met the logistical challenges, delivering the world’s biggest sporting event for the half-million visitors who flocked to Rio for South America’s first Olympics.“We know the city isn’t an easy place to live in, but Rio flung its arms wide open, and we need to congratulate ourselves for our receptiveness and joy in making such a beautiful party,” said Naidê Gouvêa Lira, 45, a logistics analyst.The ebullience was further buoyed on Saturday by the Brazilian soccer team’s win over Germany, a victory that yielded one of the country’s seven gold medals in the Games and helped ease the sting of its humiliating 2014 World Cup loss to the Germans.Over all, Brazilians seemed satisfied with their relatively modest medal count, which placed the country among the top 14 nations, its best Olympic showing ever. Many are still savoring their first gold of the Rio Games, won in judo by Rafaela Silva, 24, a black woman from an impoverished part of Rio.“To see her win really lifted our spirits,” said Fabio Costa dos Santos, 47, an unemployed carpenter who, like Silva, hails from City of God, a favela in the city’s western suburbs.The Games were far from trouble free. Even after the authorities deployed an 85,000-strong security force to ease crime fears, Portugal’s education minister was robbed at knifepoint. An Olympic bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks.Outside the Olympic bubble, gun battles between the police and drug gangs in Complexo do Alemão, a collection of favelas, the poor urban areas that emerged as squatter settlements, were a stubborn reminder of the untamed violence and yawning inequities in a city that officials had promised would be the world’s safest during the Games.A police officer deployed to Rio for the Games was killed when the vehicle he was in came under fire in a favela controlled by drug gangs. The killing of the officer, Hélio Vieira Andrade, from Roraima State in the Brazilian Amazon, focused scrutiny on Rio’s priorities during the Olympics.“There wasn’t even a tear shed for him in the ocean that was the Olympics,” Fernando Gabeira, a politician and writer, said, noting the contrast with emotions expressed around the victories and defeats of Brazil’s athletes.Transportation gridlock frustrated visitors as they rushed between events on opposite sides of a sprawling metropolis. And many people complained about the glaring sight of empty seats, even at the closing ceremony, partly the result of unsold tickets that proved unaffordable to the working poor.The organizers seemed to stumble on several fronts, at least early on. Long security lines and shortages of food at some sites left spectators grumbling. A mysterious green tint in the diving and water polo pools was highly embarrassing.In the country as a whole, Brazilians gave mixed assessments as to whether hosting the Olympics had been worth the expense and effort. Sixty-two percent said the Games were damaging for the country, compared with just 30 percent who saw the Olympics as bringing gains, according to a public opinion survey released on Sunday by Ibope, a Brazilian polling company.Still, 57 percent of Brazilians said that the Olympics had generated a more positive image of the country around the world, according to Ibope. The poll, conducted from Aug. 11 to 15 in interviews with 2,002 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.Those mixed feelings produced something of a paradox: a “wasteful event that worked out,” in the words of José Roberto de Toledo, a columnist for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, who analyzed the poll.Still, many of the worst fears proved unfounded. Zika, the mosquito-borne virus that prompted some foreign athletes to stay home, was largely forgotten as the Games got underway.So, too, were anxieties over a potential terrorist attack. And while the state government failed to meet promises that it would clean up the sewage-infested Guanabara Bay, boating competitions took place without any collisions between sailors and floating sofas.Anderson Gurgel, a sports researcher at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in São Paulo, commended the organizers for dealing with the unexpected problems, although he said they were sometimes slow to act.“Every event of this size has problems; the issue is how to manage them,” Gurgel said. “Brazilians need to learn things won’t always go wrong, that there won’t always be chaos.”One the most thrilling moments of Sunday’s ceremony involved the recognition of the work of Ms. Guidon, the archaeologist who pioneered excavations at Serra da Capivara, a forbidding bastion of caves with thousands of prehistoric paintings. Sadly, the celebration of the site in northeastern Brazil comes as it is in the grip of a severe financial crisis.Still, the closing ceremony exuded simplicity while lacking the over-the-top dazzle of other Olympic spectacles, creating a buoyant atmosphere inside Maracanã by mixing performances by contemporary musicians like Lenine with homages for giants of Brazilian culture like the composer Luiz Gonzaga. Athletes paraded under the rain to the samba tunes.The Rio Games will also be remembered for a debacle that was not of its own making: the false claims by the American swimmer Ryan Lochte that he and some of his teammates had been pulled over and robbed at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police officers.On Saturday, Lochte tried to put the controversy to rest by admitting that he had exaggerated the details of the incident. “I let my team down,” he told NBC News. “I learned my lesson.”Still, the victory of Brazil’s national soccer team over Germany’s allowed many in the country to pivot from the episode involving the swimmers. Globo, Brazil’s dominant television network, luxuriated in the conquest of the soccer gold medal, devoting the bulk of its nightly news program to the triumph.But even amid the celebrations, the rising polarization of Brazil’s unruly if functioning democracy was on display.When Globo focused its cameras on revelers celebrating in Rio’s old center, a cry from the crowd of “Globo golpista!” (“Putschist Globo!”) interrupted the newscast, revealing even at that moment the political divisiveness persisting during the Games. (Globo is viewed by some of its critics as supporting the ouster of the suspended president, Dilma Rousseff.)Indeed, the sense of reverie will be tested in the coming weeks as Brazilians confront the ugly realities of surging unemployment, rampant corruption and the intensifying political drama in the capital, Brasília.The respite will be brief: In the coming days, Brazil’s Senate will start its trial of Ms. Rousseff on charges that she illegally manipulated the federal budget. Michel Temer, the interim president, did not event attend the closing spectacle after he was greeted with a chorus of boos during the opening ceremony.For Rio residents, the intoxicating mood of the past two weeks will inevitably give way to an array of challenges: the inadequate sewage-treatment system, the growing poverty and a broken state government unable to pay thousands of civil servants on time. Rio’s mayor, Eduardo Paes, who hitched his political fortunes to the organization of the Games, was booed when he appeared on stage Sunday night, a reception that stood in contrast to the applause for Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who appeared to mark the transition to the next Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.Most worrisome, many say, is what happens after the tens of thousands of soldiers and military police personnel who were dispatched to Rio for the Games go back to their home states. A last-minute cash infusion from the federal government helped finance the surge in security, but a police union official has warned of strikes should the city’s police force go unpaid.Elizabeth Rezende, 61, a retired maid, said she was bracing for a return of the status quo. “Sure, the Games have been a good thing for Rio, but once they are over, poor people like us will be back in hell,” she said. “We’ll be locked in our homes while the criminals roam the streets with impunity.”
