WASHINGTON — With guns emerging as a major flash point in the presidential race and campaigns nationwide, gun-control advocates are spending tens of millions of dollars on a central message: Stronger firearms laws can reduce gun violence.Although the National Rifle Association has long rejected that assertion, a growing body of evidence from academics, advocacy groups and others supports the link between gun restrictions and a reduction in violence.The latest analysis comes out Wednesday from the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal group that supports toughened gun control. It concludes that gun fatalities in states with weaker laws are more than three times as high as in those states with tougher restrictions, including background checks or permits.Gun control has traditionally been a radioactive political issue in America. But voters in four states with gun measures on the ballot — California, Maine, Nevada and Washington — appear likely to approve toughened restrictions next month, and the gun debate is playing out in dozens of congressional campaigns as well.In the presidential race, the N.R.A. has spent more than $20 million on advertisements backing Donald J. Trump, who has voiced his strong support for gun rights, while urging gun right supporters to rise up against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.Although many prominent Republicans have abandoned Mr. Trump in recent days over the release of a lewd recording, the N.R.A. has not wavered in its support — mainly out of fear over what the Supreme Court would look like if Mrs. Clinton were president.“Trump would appoint Supreme Court justices who respect the Constitution and would uphold an individual’s right to bear arms,” Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A.’s lobbying arm, said. “Hillary Clinton would not.”With Congress still deadlocked over imposing new firearms measures, gun-control advocates have turned increasingly to state ballot initiatives and legislative races — with a string of successes in the last few years.Eight states have begun requiring universal background checks since the mass shooting in 2013 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, bringing the total number to 18. And polls indicate broad support for toughened gun restrictions in all four of the states considering initiatives next month.“We feel really excited about what’s happened on the gun issue this cycle,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director for Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun-control-advocacy group. “The politics have shifted in a rather tectonic way.”Another gun-control group, Everytown for Gun Safety, funded in large part by Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, said this week that it would spend $25 million this election cycle, including Mrs. Clinton’s presidential bid, state ballot initiatives and individual races in 20 states.If voters in Nevada and Maine approve their ballot measures requiring background checks next month, that would be a milestone of sorts — bringing about 50 percent of the nation’s population under comprehensive checks in gun purchases, said John Feinblatt, the group’s president.“In a relatively short time, we’ve taken this issue out of the wilderness,” he said.At a time of rising homicide rates in some major cities, the authors of the new report from the Center for American Progress believe their findings on the link between gun measures and public safety should bolster those efforts to impose tougher restrictions.The group, which did a more limited study on the issue three and a half years ago, used 10 gun-crime and violence indicators for each state, including homicides, suicides and accidental shootings, and weighed them against how restrictive a state’s gun laws are.The findings indicated a “strong” correlation between stricter gun laws and lower rates of violence, said Chelsea Parsons, one of the report’s authors.States with relatively tough gun laws, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, generally had much lower rates of gun violence, while those with looser gun laws — including Alaska, Louisiana and Mississippi — had higher rates, the study found.While the center is unabashedly in favor of tougher gun measures, Daniel Webster, an expert on gun violence at Johns Hopkins University, who reviewed the findings, said its methods were scientifically sound and expanded on previous research on the issue.“I can’t think of a study that’s as encompassing in all the different metrics — suicide, homicides, accidental shootings, mass shootings, police shootings,” Mr. Webster said.Mr. Webster led previous studies at Johns Hopkins that found a significant increase in gun homicides in Missouri after the state repealed its gun licensing law — and a significant decrease in gun homicides in Connecticut after it enacted a new licensing requirement.The new data, combined with past research, showed “an amazing consistency” in establishing a link between gun laws and reduced violence, he said.But the N.R.A. remains unconvinced.Ms. Baker, the group’s spokeswoman, said such studies “cherry picked” the evidence, and she pointed to research by John Lott, a popular conservative researcher, as evidence that tougher gun restrictions have no real effect on reducing gun violence or deaths.“Poorly drafted ballot initiatives in states like Maine and Nevada do nothing to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms and committing crimes,” she said.“What we do know is they have unintended consequences that criminalize common practices of otherwise law-abiding citizens,” such as hunting or sports shooting, she said.The N.R.A. has spent $5 million on ads to try to defeat the Nevada background-check initiative, and it is spending another $550,000 on advertisements in Maine that started this week.One commercial in Maine features a dozen sheriffs opposed to a background check measure that, as Sheriff Jeffrey Trafton of Waldo County says in the spot, “would not stop criminals from getting guns.”
