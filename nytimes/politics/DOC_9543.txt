Wheat noodles blur at the edges. At their core, they taste of cooked flour, or flour and egg, but toward the surface, they take on the flavor of their sauce. Think of pappardelle allied with a meaty ragù, or spools of ramen entwined with pork broth, throwing off starch, drinking in soup. Their boundaries dissolve.Rice noodles have very little flavor of their own and generally don’t take on much, either. They tend to make a hard break with their surrounding flavors; the more intense those flavors, the more welcome the break. They are almost pure texture.The favorite noodle in the Yunnan Province of southwestern China is a long, round, spaghetti-like rice noodle called mixian. It is the specialty at Little Tong Noodle Shop, a small, new, inexpensive restaurant in the East Village. Little Tong’s mixian seems to have a barely perceptible sour tang, but it is the very soft and elusively smooth texture that is most memorable. Just when your mouth is about to get some purchase on the noodles, away they slip.Little Tong Noodle Shop plunges mixian into soups and sauces that make a definite impression. Yunnan shares borders with Tibet, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos; northern Thailand is not too far, either. The characteristic Southeast Asian tension of saltiness, sourness and chile heat creeps into these noodle bowls. They are buoyed by green herbs, too, by mint and cilantro, and by the tendency of the chef, Simone Tong, to twist contrasting strands of flavor together.Fundamentally, the banna shrimp mixian is a tomato soup, removed from Campbell’s reach by a whiff of smoke and a slight taste of shrimp and crab shells. Wheels of pickled green chiles add not just heat but depth; there are fried shallots, too, and fresh mint, stirred in along with coconut.In the grandma chicken mixian, a dark and grainy oil slick — a distillation of garlic and black sesame — dyes and deepens a chicken broth that is already so full-bodied it’s almost sticky. Resting on top of the rice noodles is chicken confit, which, in terms of moistness and flavor, is the exact opposite of the desiccated, used-up meat typically found in chicken soups. There are spicy red bits of fermented chile, some salty and sour pickles, an egg boiled in pu-erh tea, and long ivory chrysanthemum petals. It has to be the most interesting chicken noodle soup in the city right now.Another soup, the “little pot” mixian, tastes something like a spicy miso ramen that has shed its excess weight and picked up extra flavors. Chopped shiitakes and pork belly sit on the surface of the salty, milky pork broth, along with garlic chives and minced stems of pickled mustard greens. If this had been ramen, I would have left some noodles behind, but I finished this bowl, all of it, in an astonished haze, and didn’t regret it.Little Tong Noodle Shop is Ms. Tong’s first restaurant as chef. She is also an owner. It is a modest place in many ways. The drinks list offers one red, one white, one rosé and a handful of beers and sakes. (The best choice may be Yunnanese tea.)There are 28 indoor seats, some pale wood slats on one wall, and exposed brick on another. The Noodle Shop does not necessarily invite comparisons to a more famous Noodle Bar three doors south on First Avenue, but it does not exactly discourage comparisons to David Chang’s restaurant, either.Like Mr. Chang, who cooked for Tom Colicchio before opening the first Momofuku, Ms. Tong threaded a path toward Asian noodles that ran through modern New York restaurant kitchens. Born in Chengdu, China, she went to culinary school in the United States. She worked as an intern for Masato Shimizu while he was still at 15 East, and cooked for Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 and Alder.It’s easier to see an American chef’s sensibility in the section of the menu called “little eats,” which are free of noodles and give Ms. Tong a chance to evoke Yunnan with East Coast ingredients. She coaxes impressive flavors from a small amount of cold Chinese broccoli dressed in citrus soy, with a salty, crunchy and smoky dusting of grated egg yolk. The “mini stir fry,” a seasonal improvisation, was made recently with fiddlehead ferns, pine nuts and tender, lime-green needles from the spring tips of spruce branches.They eat flowers in Yunnan, and Ms. Tong seems to recognize the value, in the age of Instagram, of a strategically deployed blossom or two. (They eat insects in Yunnan, too, but you don’t see her garnishing plates with deep-fried bamboo grubs.) In the case of the excellent egg drop soup, the stray petals had less presence than the corn kernels and salmon roe and the rags of cooked egg whites in the translucent broth.But I liked the peppery bite that chrysanthemum brought to the grandma chicken mixian and found the rose petals on the Yunnan salad to be more than just decorative. You will think this salad belongs in a trattoria when I tell you that it is composed mainly of radicchio and prosciutto, but no Italian would then go on to add fresh pineapple and boiled beef tendon.One night I ate peanut butter cookies for dessert. I’ve never seen them again. Where in Yunnan they came from, I don’t know; where they’ve gone, I can only guess. My latest meal there ended with six flavors of fruit sorbet in gumball-size scoops topped, of course, with edible flowers.The noodles cost either $14 or $15, except for one special, which is $16. Every appetizer is under $10 except the chopped raw beef, which is dressed with shallot oil and chile oil and can be spread on flaky, oily scallion bread with a daub of Sichuan-spiced beef fat or a swipe of smoked egg yolk. For this I paid $13 without griping. In fact, because Little Tong’s prices include service, they all seemed too low to be real.I wouldn’t mind if Ms. Tong asked $16 or $17 for noodles, rather than charging $1 each for chile oil, chile soy sauce and fermented chiles. People in Yunnan like to doctor their broth to taste from a whole range of condiments and spices; it’s part of the experience. Ms. Tong has a precise palate, I think, but there were times when I wanted to recalibrate the broth.Little Tong Noodle Shop is strict about not seating incomplete parties, even when the place is empty. Once you have a table, though, the servers are quick and sympathetic.The dining room is overseen by Emmeline Zhao, who has the twin titles of general manager and panda caretaker. One of the sakes comes in a glass decorated with painted pandas, like an old Welch’s jelly jar. Panda art hangs in the front window, and if you are ever called on to administer the Heimlich maneuver to a panda, the custom-drawn choking poster by the restroom door should provide all the information you need.Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
