Donald J. Trump will become president of the United States after he says just 35 words: the oath of office. What is the oath, you may ask?Presidents-elect have taken the oath since the beginning of the republic. George Washington first said it in 1789, and the oath has been the centerpiece of presidential inaugurations ever since, symbolizing the continuity of democratic rule and the peaceful transition of power.The oath of office comes directly from Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. This is the full text, according to the National Museum of American History:The oath is traditionally administered by the chief justice of the United States, but sometimes that can be harder than it looks.In 2009, Justice John G. Roberts Jr. garbled the oath while swearing in Barack Obama.Chief Justice Roberts misspoke — he said, “I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully.”Then, he left out the word “execute” altogether. Mr. Obama, for his part, seemed to realize the chief justice’s mistake.Mr. Obama’s aides said that they believed the oath was valid, even if it had not gone according to plan. But he was sworn in a second time before a small, private audience the next day — just to make sure.Before they began, Mr. Obama joked with the chief justice, “We’re going to do it very slowly.”
