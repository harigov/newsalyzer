What a difference 10 days make.Iran’s president is in Europe this week, shaking hands with leaders, inking billion-dollar business deals and making headlines that would have been hard to imagine just a few months ago.Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted on Jan. 16, the country, which for years was considered a pariah and isolated because of its nuclear ambitions, has engaged in something of a charm offensive.Here are a few of the ways a newly unfettered Iran has been getting back to business and engaging again with the world.• President Hassan Rouhani met with Pope Francis on Tuesday, the first meeting between a pope and an Iranian head of state in 17 years. Mr. Rouhani also met with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and businesses leaders, signing more than a dozen deals during his visit to Italy.• The Danieli Group, a metal manufacturer, signed accords totaling 5.7 billion euros, or $6.2 billion, to build steel and aluminum plants in Iran.• The Saipem oil services company, controlled by the Eni energy company, agreed to a plan to upgrade Iranian refineries and pipelines, though the details of the agreement were not made public.• The Italian State Railways and the shipbuilding company Fincantieri signed agreements on infrastructure projects.• On Thursday, Mr. Rouhani is scheduled to meet with President François Hollande to sign a deal to buy more than 100 planes from Airbus, the European conglomerate. Iran has said it hopes to buy as many 400 planes over the next decade to replace its aging fleet.• The automakers PSA Peugeot Citroën and Renault-Nissan hope to close deals in order to regain their lost market share in Iran since sanctions were enacted.• Two of Germany’s biggest companies have deals pending with Iran: Siemens signed a preliminary agreement to provide $1.6 billion worth of transportation equipment, and Daimler said last week that it planned to produce trucks and engines with an Iranian partner and to open a company office in Iran by April.• The two largest American automakers, General Motors and Ford, said Monday that the revised sanctions did not yet allow them to do business in Iran.• Despite no plans to increase trade, the United States and Iran announced on Jan. 16 a high-profile prisoner exchange, in which several Iranian-Americans including Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter, were released.
