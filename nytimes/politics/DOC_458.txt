To the Editor:Re “2 More Defections Lead to Collapse of Health Effort” (front page, July 18):In what must be the most embarrassing moment in an already failed presidency, the collapse of the Republican-led effort to repeal and replace Obamacare is a defeat not only for President Trump, but for the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, as well.Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas stepped forward, but there were probably other senators who would have voted no as well but who were protected from casting a vote that could have spelled disaster for them in 2018.Now we learn that repeal-only is dead, but the damage has been done. Congress has shown that it will not leap off a cliff for a president who doesn’t have their backs, who doesn’t barnstorm for his biggest campaign promise, and who knows little or nothing about health care.The defeat of the Republican plan presents what may be the last opportunity for Congress to act in a bipartisan fashion and adopt a single-payer Medicare-for-all health care delivery system financed through tax increases on the wealthy and run by professionals who, unlike the president and his administration, actually understand health care.HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:On Monday, President Trump asked Congress to pass a repeal-only bill. Really? How could we possibly have confidence in a plan to take away health care entirely, with a dubious promissory note to come up with a better (maybe) plan after we’ve witnessed years of Republican finagling and failure?I shudder to think how many people would have to die, just waiting.LOIS BLOOM, WILLIAMSBURG, VA.To the Editor:Finally, President Trump has got it right. He blames “Democrats and a few Republicans” for refusing to destroy health care for millions.Democrats should be pleased to take the blame (“credit” would be a more accurate word) for protecting the Affordable Care Act. Not only is this morally the right thing to do; it is politically right, too, since a majority of Americans now support it.GAIL GOLDEY, HARRISON, N.Y.To the Editor:Since both parties have acknowledged certain flaws in the Affordable Care Act, bipartisan legislation to amend and improve the law, not repeal and replace it, should be the focus.The Republicans would get a much-needed victory, and the Democrats would also benefit, since the law would include at least some of their ideas. And those of us who are covered by the law would benefit as well.ANDREW GOLDSTEINPHILADELPHIATo the Editor:The collapse of the health care process demonstrates that Republicans cannot make a deal with themselves.Now President Trump will relive the darkest arts of the deal and try to force his opponents to come to the table by threat. It will become a suicide pact that will erode the insurance market for two years.And people who voted for Donald Trump will suffer, probably in silence. Mr. Trump owns only a hammer and everyone becomes a nail.TIM FITZMAURICE SANTA CRUZ, CALIF.The writer, a Democrat, is a former mayor of Santa Cruz.To the Editor:It’s unbelievable that President Trump now blames the Democrats because his Republican Party could not pass a new health care bill. Did he forget that the Democrats (and most Republicans) were completely shut out of the process to draw up this proposed bill?Rather than trying to bring the two parties together, to be a peacemaker, this president seems to be widening the gulf between the parties and lashing out for his own losses. How did we get in this position?JENNIFER DORN, NEW YORK
