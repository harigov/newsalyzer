If you’re tempted to take a selfie at the polls on Election Day, you may find yourself on the wrong side of the law.The laws in several states have been challenged at the last minute, leading to a legal back-and-forth in at least four states, including Michigan, New York, California and Colorado. (It’s still illegal in three of those states, except for Colorado, where a federal judge ruled on Friday that a ban on ballot selfies couldn’t be enforced, according to a report from The Associated Press.)Before you take a selfie of your ballot (or of yourself) at the polls, refer to this updated map of laws by state:ALLOWED: ColoradoConnecticutDistrict of ColumbiaHawaiiIdahoIndianaKentuckyLouisianaMaineMinnesotaMontanaNebraskaNew HampshireNorth DakotaOregonRhode IslandUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWyomingNOT ALLOWED: AlabamaAlaskaCaliforniaFloridaGeorgiaIllinoisKansasMassachusettsMichiganMississippiNevadaNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaWisconsinUNCLEAR:ArizonaArkansasDelawareIowaMarylandMissouriOhioOklahomaPennsylvaniaTennesseeTexasWest Virginia
