John M. Broder is editor of News Surveys.Margot Sanger-Katz of The Upshot has a revealing story online now about the burdens of medical costs on millions of Americans, even those who have, or thought they had, adequate health insurance.Sharp-eyed readers of the methodology box accompanying the article, “How the Poll on Medical Bills Was Conducted,” will notice a departure from The Times’s usual polling methods. It notes that the health survey was conducted in large part online.The Times and its longstanding polling partner, CBS News, customarily conduct their national and state polls using live interviewers, reaching respondents by landline and mobile telephones. The Times and CBS News have long believed that a live telephone survey of a random sample of Americans is the most accurate and replicable way to measure public opinion.Here is an explanation of the customary Times/CBS News methodology that accompanied our most recent national poll in December.But the health care survey, done in partnership with the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, was conducted both over the telephone and online, reaching a total of 2,575 adults. The sampling, interviewing and tabulation of survey results were conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, one of the nation’s most respected public opinion centers.(CBS News did not participate in the health survey.)The Times has generally shied away from online polling, with the exception of a short-lived experiment The Upshot did with the Internet-based polling firm YouGov in 2014.For the health care survey, NORC used its AmeriSpeak Panel, a group of survey respondents recruited at random (a so-called probability sample) based on a sample of addresses across the United States. NORC’s sample frame draws on both Postal Service and census data to create a list of nearly three million households, and is designed to be representative of 99 percent of the population.Nearly 2,000 members of the panel were given the health care survey online; 619 without Internet access were interviewed over the phone.The polling establishment — including the 40-year-old New York Times/CBS News Poll — has viewed online polling with skepticism because it is difficult to achieve a random national sample using online interviews. There are also questions about how self-selected (so-called opt-in) respondents may differ from a truly random sample of the public. It is also impossible, so far at least, to calculate a margin of sampling error for an online-only population sample.But with large numbers of the public abandoning landline phones and response rates dropping, some form of online polling appears inevitable.Liz Hamel, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s survey research team, said that it would continue to rely on telephone polling for much of its work, but that it is also exploring how to integrate online surveys into its research. Using the Internet to reach selected subgroups of the population allows in-depth studies that otherwise would be too costly and time consuming, she said.“The Kaiser Family Foundation is committed to giving voice to some of the hardest to reach groups in America whose views can easily be left out of public debates, like the 26% of adults who have problems paying medical bills, a group with disproportionately lower incomes,” Ms. Hamel said in an email.“The panel design — recruiting using probability sampling and conducting most interviews through a less-expensive web mode while also allowing those without Internet access to be surveyed by phone — gives us confidence that we’re accurately representing the group in a cost-efficient manner,” she added.The Times will be looking for other opportunities to use new methods to measure public opinion. We have no firm timetable or new plans to announce yet, but stay tuned.
