Two former detainees held by the Central Intelligence Agency filed a suit on Tuesday against James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, psychologists who helped develop the harsh interrogation methods once used in secret C.I.A. prisons around the world. The lawsuit — joined by the family of a third detainee who died in C.I.A. custody in Afghanistan in 2002 — alleges that the prisoners were tortured using techniques brought to the C.I.A. by Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Jessen while the pair were contractors for the agency at the beginning of its detention program. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit in a federal court in Spokane, Wash., on behalf of the former prisoners: Suleiman Abdullah Salim, Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud and Gul Rahman. A report by the Senate Intelligence Committee released last year describes extensively the work that the two men did, although the report uses the pseudonyms Grayson Swigert and Hammond Dunbar.
