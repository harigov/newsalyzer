Thirteen North Koreans working at a North Korean government-run restaurant abroad defected together to South Korea this week, the South’s government said on Friday.They were the largest group of North Koreans to defect to the South together in recent years.A government-sent male manager and 12 female workers at a North Korean restaurant overseas arrived in the South on Thursday asking for political asylum, the Unification Ministry of the South said in a statement on Friday. The ministry did not disclose the whereabouts of the restaurant.The defectors were among tens of thousands of North Koreans working abroad at factories, construction sites, logging camps and restaurants in China, Russia, the Middle East and Africa to help their government earn badly needed foreign currency.After the United Nations imposed sanctions on North Korea in early March to punish it for its recent nuclear and long-range rocket tests, South Korea asked its citizens not to visit North Korean-run restaurants in China, Southeast Asia or elsewhere.In such restaurants, North Korean women perform music and dances as well as serve food. The restaurants have become popular among tourists from the South eager for a rare chance to sample the North’s cuisine and performances and to talk with North Koreans.The latest defectors told South Korean investigators that they developed a yearning to defect while watching movies and television dramas from the South and learning more about the country through the Internet while working abroad, the Unification Ministry said on Friday.As food scarcity in the North has worsened in recent decades, more than 20,000 North Koreans have fled to the South, most of them through China. In 1987, a family of 11 fled by sea to South Korea. In 1997, a family of 14 fled there, also by sea. In 2002, an additional 21 North Koreans used a boat to defect together to the South.
