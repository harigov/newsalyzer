Galerie Lelong528 West 26th StreetChelseaThrough June 16The line between painting and participatory art forms is looking awfully blurry these days. For that we owe much to the Brazilian artist Hélio Oiticica (1937-80), who in the early 1960s initiated a series of artworks called “Penetrables” — essentially installations that physicalized color theory by allowing viewers to walk into, or through, monumental abstract paintings. Three are installed at Galerie Lelong, where they convey something of their initial radicalism.In the show’s centerpiece, “Penetrável Filtro” (1972), you wind your way through a labyrinth that affords glimpses of the gallery through tinted plastic panels. Along the way you pass through curtains of the same material: green, blue, yellow and orange, as well as others made from opaque black fabric and white mesh. At the end, where you encounter an orange-juice dispenser and a set of plastic cups and are encouraged to use them, you feel as though you’ve been pressed and strained yourself (in a good way).Two smaller “Penetrables” offer more concise, but almost as rewarding, experiences. “Penetrável PN1” (1960) invites you to enter a small wooden shed and slide its orange- and yellow-painted walls into various configurations; its sunny colors obviate claustrophobia. The later “Penetrável PN28 ‘Nas Quebradas’ ” (1979), a more open structure perched atop a pile of gravel, is modeled on the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and looks appropriately precarious. The wood and brick walls and jute roof don’t move, but the rocks shifting underfoot create the illusion of instability.Any contemporary artist or curator proposing an “interactive” installation should take a close look at Oiticica’s “Penetrables,” which open up painting without closing off too many options.
