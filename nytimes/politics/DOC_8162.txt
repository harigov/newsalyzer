BeijingBack in the States, every New Year’s Day, decades of listeners enjoyed hearing Keith Jackson describe the Rose Bowl game of college football as “the granddaddy of them all.”In the Summer Games, track and field is the granddaddy of them all. It roars to life every four years, filling stadiums as gymnastics and swimming shut down.The people in the stands might not follow this sport from one Olympiad to another, but they know drama and athleticism when they see it. On Tuesday night, they roared for Usain Bolt of Jamaica even though he virtually jogged to a victory in a 200-meter semifinal, and they cheered for Roqaya al-Gassra of Bahrain, wearing the form-fitting hood and overshirt of hijab, the cover of Muslim piety, as she won her semifinal heat in the 200.But track and field tends to vanish between Olympic Games, except for hard-core fans. Now two progressive thinkers are wondering if the world could be attracted to phenomenons like Bolt if they were presented in some rational pattern over four years, without the current blight of drugs.“I’ve got family who want to know that what they are watching is legitimate,” said Sebastian Coe, who won the gold medal in the 1,500 in 1980 and ’84, and is now the chairman of the organizing committee for the 2012 London Games.Coe recently dropped into Beijing to deliver a cheery update on London’s progress (to worrywarts who fretted about England’s rain, he promised to erect a dome over the entire island).Also a vice president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Coe is urging his sport to embrace testing, saying the Balco scandals in the United States “will not be the last scandal, but we are better to face short-term embarrassment.”In the broader view, Coe said, “Forty-somethings are loyal fans, but it’s different for younger fans.” He said his sport must “start attracting great athletes like Beckham and Federer.”“Football gets 90 percent of the talent,” he said, using the world’s name for soccer, “but then it gets rid of 90 percent of that talent between 14 and 18. The kid who hoped would make it, you realize he’s not going to be a national-level midfielder, but he’s got a great first five steps, he could be a great sprinter.”The father of four children, Coe said young people were attracted to the X Games on skateboards and other new devices, and he recognized the advance of other sports. “Go to the West Indies and ask cricket people what basketball has done to their sport,” he said.He said major track and field meets were too long, too disjointed, to attract the short-twitch minds of young people. “The formula of our world championship is 9-10 days, five events in three hours,” Coe said. “We’ve got to present our sport better, in one-day meets.”As it happens, Coe has found a kindred soul in Doug Logan, the new head of USA Track & Field. Logan, the first commissioner of Major League Soccer, has called on President Bush to not commute the six-month sentence of Marion Jones, who is jailed for lying in connection with the Balco scandal and who has lost her Olympic medals because she used performance-enhancing drugs.“Nobody will succeed if drugs continue to be the first or second or third question,” Logan said, referring to track’s news conferences. Then he lamented the marginal state of the sport.“Track and field kept ambling down the road while all those Ferraris passed them,” he said. “The N.F.L.; what David Stern did with basketball; Mark McCormack, a genius, built golf on a new business model; Donald Dell and others in tennis; the France family with Nascar.”Born in Cuba, Logan attended Manhattan College and fell in love with big-time track of the 1960s, particularly the Millrose Games. He said, “I can still hear the footsteps on those wooden boards, with all those splinters — Ron Delany, Eamonn Coghlan in the Wanamaker Mile.”Now, he said, “We’ve got to blow it up and start all over.” He lamented the Balkanized calendar that had American athletes qualifying in the trials in June but then there was “a five-week hiatus, with four or five European meets, with our kids flying all over the place.” As a result, he said, many performances are down from their peak in June.The sport could be “a marketer’s dream,” Logan said, adding: “The rules are simple — get there first. Everybody has tried to race his older brother.” He also criticized the cost and elapsed time of the world championships, noting that the Prefontaine meet in Oregon every spring “gets it all done in 2 ½ hours.”He concluded: “U.S.A.T.F. has to be the promoter of the last resort. We have to cajole people out of their narrow point of view.” As a former rock promoter, Logan predicted that Usain Bolt could “fill Icahn Stadium single-handedly any time he wants,” referring to the modest stadium under the Triborough Bridge.On May 31, Bolt set a world record of 9.72 at that stadium, and the other night he dropped it to 9.69 while thumping his chest. Bolt has galvanized the Bird’s Nest. With new leadership, maybe Bolt and his Jamaican running mates could make the “granddaddy of them all” relevant more than once every four years.
