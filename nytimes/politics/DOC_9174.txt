An Iranian airline blacklisted under United States sanctions has bought nine used Airbus passenger planes, in a move that could further complicate the multilateral talks aimed at resolving Iran’s disputed nuclear program by the end of next month. The Iranian news media reported Sunday that the airline, Mahan Air, bought the aircraft — eight Airbus A340s and one A321 — for an undisclosed amount from unidentified sellers, and that they were placed into service last week. The Iranian news accounts described the purchase as an important boost for the country’s civilian aviation industry, which has struggled for many years because of an aging fleet and American-imposed restrictions on access to replacement aircraft, parts, technology and service. Mahan Air was placed on a sanctions list in October 2011 by the Treasury Department over what it called the airline’s support for activities of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Quds Force and Hezbollah militants. The purchase could inflame congressional critics of the nuclear talks who contend that Iran cannot be trusted and that it already is openly flouting the sanctions.
