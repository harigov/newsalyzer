The drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera’s escape from a maximum-security prison on Saturday using a well-constructed tunnel is the latest in a string of brazen escapes from Mexican penitentiaries over the years.The ease with which some prisoners have managed to escape has been a source of embarrassment for a country that has struggled with its efforts to contain the drug trade and the subsequent violence between rival gangs vying for territorial control.For Mr. Guzmán — known as El Chapo, or “Shorty” — the escape from the Altiplano, Mexico’s most secure prison, is the second time he has managed to find a way out from behind prison doors.In 2001, he is said to have escaped from the Puente Grande, another high-security prison, using a laundry cart that was pushed outside by a maintenance worker.Mr. Guzmán is not the only prisoner who has made use of an elaborate escape tunnel. In 2012, over 130 prisoners used a tunnel to break out from a prison in Piedras Negras, just south of the United States border with Mexico near Texas.In 2012, 44 inmates were killed as part of a diversion that allowed 30 members of Los Zetas, a powerful drug cartel, to escape from a prison in Apodaca.The killings in 2012 were just one of many diversionary tactics that inmates have employed to help a breakout. In 2009, 53 inmates escaped after they were given over to men disguised in police uniforms.
