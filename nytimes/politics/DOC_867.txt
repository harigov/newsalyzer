Strong winds, dry weather and high temperatures: The fire season is in full swing across the Mediterranean.In France, fires raged on Tuesday less than 10 miles from the resort city of Nice. In Croatia, fires have damaged homes in the historic city of Split. And in Montenegro, the authorities have asked NATO for assistance in dealing with fires that had forced evacuations along the coast.Firefighters, backed by planes spraying fire-retardant materials, were trying to contain a blaze in the southern French town of Castagniers, just north of Nice. Significant fires were also reported in the Provence region of southeastern France, and on the French island of Corsica.The fire near Nice began Monday evening but was “under control” by midday Tuesday, Jean-Gabriel Delacroy of the Alpes-Maritimes administrative department told The Associated Press, adding that no homes had been damaged.The fires that threatened Split, the second largest city in Croatia, were also largely under control after a dozen houses burned along the coast, The A.P. reported, citing Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic.The situation improved after winds died down, Mr. Plenkovic said, but only after threatening parts of the Split suburbs and spreading across hundreds of acres along the coast.The Continent got a taste of what was to come last month, when a blaze tore through central Portugal, leaving more than 60 people dead; Prime Minister António Costa said the fire had brought “a dimension of human tragedy that we cannot remember.”Portugal hasn’t been spared from the latest devastation, with fires now burning in the Mangualde district, about 75 miles north of where the blazes spread last month.In Montenegro, the government asked NATO for two firefighting aircraft and two helicopters to help interventions on the Lustica Peninsula. Montenegro became a full member of NATO just last month, and the alliance said on Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to send a firefighting plane after the request was “immediately” circulated.More than 100 people were evacuated around the town of Tivat, on the Adriatic coast, The A.P. reported, and there were smaller fires along the coast.Officials reported nearly 900 wildfires in Italy on Monday, with people evacuated from residential as well as touristy parts of Rome and Naples, and around Mount Vesuvius, near Naples.On Monday, firefighters extinguished a wildfire that destroyed a vast portion of the Castelfusano pine forest near the coast south of Rome, and the authorities arrested a man suspected of arson. Fires have also ravaged the national park on Vesuvius for several days, and a beach resort on the western tip of Sicily was evacuated last week.Thousands of acres of pine forests, national parks, fields and pastures have burned in central and southern Italy in recent weeks. There were 30 percent more wildfires in June and July than there were a year earlier, officials said, and rain levels have fallen, also by 30 percent.
