WHO buys the print edition of the newspaper? Just a few Luddites who wouldn’t know a smartphone if their horse-drawn buggy crushed it on the cobblestones? Octogenarians and their older brothers?That seems to be the conventional wisdom. On Twitter, Chris Boutet had a funny line recently. “The following is a list of people who still subscribe to newspapers: Journalists, their parents.”It reminded me of a joke about the weather in my beloved hometown. “There are two seasons in Buffalo: the Fourth of July and everything else.” Not quite true, of course — May to November is pretty great — but then neither is Mr. Boutet’s joke.There’s no doubt about the downward trajectory of print. But where, exactly, are we on that path? And how do younger people fit into that picture? I thought it would be worthwhile to find out, since it’s bound to affect The Times and its readers. And some of the answers may be surprising.But, first, I want to say something clearly. Although this particular column is about the printed newspaper, I am a fervent believer in the need to move ahead on the digital front with a sense of urgency, which is what The Times is doing.I read The Times in many forms every day — first through what arrives on social media, then on the web site, then in print at my desk, and later in the day back to the first two. I probably read more news, of all kinds, on my phone than anywhere else.But for those who might say “who cares?” about the printed newspaper, there’s reason to pause. Try these tidbits: More than 70 percent of all revenue at The Times came from print last year. The biggest share of that is “consumer revenue” from print — almost exclusively, that’s from people who buy the newspaper either with a home-delivery subscription or on the newsstand. But print advertising revenue is very important, too. More than a million people still buy the Sunday paper each week. The number has declined to about 1.1 million from 1.8 million at its height in 1993. And about 645,000 people still pay for the daily paper, which has taken the biggest hit. (The daily numbers fell by about 6 percent last year; on Sunday, the number fell by about 3.5 percent.) A lot of younger people buy and read the paper in print. Of all subscribers, 23 percent are in their 20s, 30s and 40s — that’s hundreds of thousands each week. They can’t all be journalists. And on the opposite side of the spectrum, the typical digital Times subscriber is decidedly not a millennial, wielding her selfie stick and heading off to Coachella. No, the median age of the digital subscriber is a graying (but no doubt Pilates-practicing) 54, not much younger than the median age of the print subscriber, which is 60.What’s more, this substantial print crowd, young and old, loves its Times passionately. Roland Caputo, the Times executive in charge of print (“It’s important that somebody carry the torch for the unsexy part of the operation”), describes the readers’ passion in simple terms. “Print readers love print,” he told me. “The affinity they have for it is astronomical.” A major Times research project on readership last summer made that clear.“That sentiment won’t change,” Mr. Caputo said, “and we have print readers of all ages.”Given that these print readers are paying most of the bills, with their advertiser-pleasing buying habits and their expensive subscriptions (some pay more than $800 a year for a seven-day subscription), The Times wants to keep them happy. That takes many forms — from making sure the paper maintains standards of journalistic excellence to getting the paper delivered on time. The strategy is to keep print readers contented and engaged because once they’re gone, it will be hard to replace them. Finding lots of new print subscribers is a job nobody wants, not even Sisyphus.One more fact: The print readers are among the most engaged with The Times’s digital offerings; these are not two separate categories of readers.Still, there’s no escaping the big question: How long will print be around? At a Loyola University gathering in New Orleans last week, the executive editor, Dean Baquet, noted that he “has as much of a romance with print as anyone.” But he also admitted, according to a Times-Picayune report, that “no one thinks there will be a lot of print around in 40 years.”Mr. Caputo, for one, is willing to make a shorter-range prediction: “There will be a print New York Times for the foreseeable future.” Will it be around in 10 years? “Absolutely.”For those who love the look and feel of the printed newspaper — the power of a dramatic front-page photograph, the serendipitous journey through the Sunday paper, the appreciation of editors’ judgments — this is good news.The Times is rightly putting a great deal of energy into attracting new mobile-device readers, launching an Instagram presence and expanding its interactive journalism. It’s working intently to make a new business model that is viable for the long haul.And it’s trying to keep costs under control, which has meant cutting some newsroom jobs and, with that, eliminating some longstanding sections like Automobiles and Home. I’ve fielded many complaints from readers who don’t like some of the specific decisions.This is a difficult balancing act and one that, in general, is being done thoughtfully. As The Times crosses the bridge to a fully digital future, it’s important to remember that today’s passionate print readers are more varied, more numerous and more valuable than conventional wisdom might suggest.
