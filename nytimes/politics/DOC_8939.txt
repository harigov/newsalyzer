Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights from The New York Times. In this piece, Ben Hubbard, a Times Middle East correspondent, and Karam Shoumali, a news assistant, reveal the promising outcome of a story they first reported in May 2015.BEIRUT, Lebanon — Rare are the cases in foreign reporting when publishing an article brings about a concrete effect, but we recently got proof that one of ours made it harder for the jihadists of the Islamic State to make bombs — in a document from the jihadists themselves.Some background: Last year while reporting in southern Turkey, we received a tip that there were large quantities of fertilizer going through the border into Syria, where the Islamic State was using it to make explosives.What’s more, it was going through an official Turkish border crossing that was supposed to be closed.It was hard to believe, so we got in the car and went to see for ourselves. Sure enough, at the crossing we saw groups of laborers pushing carts filled with bags of fertilizer across the border.Of course, fertilizer is meant for farming, and only certain types are good for making explosives. But we clearly saw markings on the bags identifying the product as ammonium nitrate, which has been a key ingredient in some of the world’s most infamous terrorist attacks, including the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 and the bombings of the United States Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998.It is also widely used by the Islamic State.Over two days, we drove by the crossing repeatedly to see how much fertilizer was going in, and we brought a photographer with us to document what we saw. In interviews around town, we found that the fertilizer shipments to Syria were an open secret, although Turkish officials denied that the material was crossing the border or insisted that it was for agriculture.In the resulting article, analysts and Western officials told us that there was no legitimate reason for a key ingredient in explosives to be going into Islamic State territory. But we had no way of proving that it was going to the Islamic State.Then we got the document.In a group of materials captured from the Islamic State by Syrian Kurdish forces and shared with The New York Times, we found a page called “Report on Reasons for the Banning of Fertilizer from Entering the Border Gate.”This Arabic-language document described how a member of the Islamic State would work with Turkish smugglers, who paid bribes to get the fertilizer through the crossing.At one point, according to the document, the group bought 125 tons of fertilizer, but it got stuck on the Turkish side of the gate because the bribe was not paid, and a dispute broke out between the smugglers. While the goods were stuck there, “American journalists came and photographed the fertilizer at the Turkish gate, and after that the road was closed and has not reopened. The New York Times newspaper said that … fertilizer was coming from Turkey to the [Islamic] State to manufacture explosives.”The document was stamped by the Islamic State’s “Emigration Committee,” and I smiled while reading it, imagining the unfortunate jihadist bureaucrat who had to explain to his boss what happened to the fertilizer supply.C.J.
