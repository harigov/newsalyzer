First Husband? First Gentleman? Presidential spouse? What will we call former President Bill Clinton if his wife, Hillary, wins on Nov. 8?This is the closest the United States has ever come to having a woman as president, and also the closest to having a male spouse in the White House. Many people are wondering what that would look like and what Mr. Clinton’s role would be.But there are plenty of precedents — beyond America’s borders. Britain, Germany and Bangladesh have female leaders today, and other countries have had them before; with them in many cases came men who either took political roles or supported them quietly in other ways. Mr. Clinton could find various role models.Joachim Sauer, Philip May, Sir Denis Thatcher, and Asif Ali Zardari are or were the partners of powerful female presidents or prime ministers, and they all interpreted the role in different ways. Will Mr. Clinton follow in their footsteps or pave his own path as America’s first First Gentleman?Declan Walsh, who is Irish and is The Times’s bureau chief in Cairo, has spent the past four months covering the presidential campaign as a foreign correspondent. This video installment of his Abroad in America series outlines some of the options.
