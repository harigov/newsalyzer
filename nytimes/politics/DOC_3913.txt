WARSAW — Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, signed a law on Thursday that gives the government greater control over state broadcasters, despite the objections of European Union officials who fear that the measure will weaken freedom of the press.The legislation will allow Poland’s new conservative government to appoint and dismiss the executives in charge of public television and radio broadcasters. Until now, politically independent bodies made those decisions.Malgorzata Sadurska, who as the head of the presidential chancellery is Mr. Duda’s top aide, said the new law was intended to ensure that the state news media are “unbiased, objective and credible.”After the lower house of the Polish Parliament passed the measure on Dec. 30, the European Commission took the extraordinary step of scheduling a discussion for Jan. 13 on rule of law in Poland. The European Union, which Poland joined in 2004, requires that member states respect the rule of law; a country that is found to systematically violate the rule of law can be stripped of voting rights, something that has never happened in the bloc’s history.“Freedom and pluralism of the media are crucial for a pluralist society,” Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, told Polish officials in a letter.The new law has added to anxiety in Brussels over the actions of Poland’s new government, which include pardoning the head of the security services, who was appealing a conviction for abuse of his office; trying to halt the production of a play it deemed “pornographic;” and vowing to overturn the previous government’s promise to accept some of the refugees pouring into Europe.
