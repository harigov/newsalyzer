BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Syrian government and a major opposition group said on Tuesday that they will observe a conditional pause in fighting set to begin Saturday, but they also made clear that they expected the exercise to make little difference in the civil war.The doubts expressed on all sides — and the volatile state of the battlefield — underscored why even the plan’s sponsors, the United States and Russia, have played down expectations ahead of the partial “cessation of hostilities.”The announcements by the Syrian Foreign Ministry and the High Negotiations Committee, which represents opposition and rebel groups, came as the Islamic State seized the town of Khanaser in eastern Aleppo Province, a step toward cutting off the supply route to the government-held section of the city of Aleppo.The advancement of Islamic State militants increases the potential for a dire situation in which the government could besiege the rebel-held part of the city and the Islamic State would try to besiege the government-held part.The plan to halt the fighting does not include the Islamic State, which holds large swaths of territory in the northeast, nor will it apply to the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, whose fighters are among rebel groups in many parts of the north.The government of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, said in its statement that it would observe the pause, but it would continue fighting those groups and others it says are allied with Al Qaeda. The government has long described all of its armed opponents this way, and insurgents believe pro-government forces will continue to strike whomever they choose.Fighters and civilians in opposition-held areas also said they did not trust the government or its main allies, Russia and Iran, to stop a military campaign that in recent weeks has displaced tens of thousands of people and has included the bombing of hospitals and schools.The High Negotiations Committee, which represented opposition and rebel groups in talks in Geneva this month, said that it expected Mr. Assad’s forces and his foreign allies to violate the cease-fire.“The regime’s survival depends on the continuation of its campaign of oppression, killing and forced displacement,” the group said in a statement.The government also announced that parliamentary elections would be held on April 13, despite the fact that insurgents hold much of several provinces.In Damascus, both supporters and opponents of the government were pessimistic, predicting that the government would keep striking armed opposition of all stripes and that the insurgents would keep striking back.“Bashar should retake the four provinces of Raqqa, Deir al-Zour, Hassaka and Idlib,” one taxi driver joked, “then talk about elections.”
