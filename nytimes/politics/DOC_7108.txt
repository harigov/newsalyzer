Here’s our analysis of the Republican debate, and our fact checks._______Donald J. Trump has won three nominating contests in a row, and Thursday night’s face-off in Houston is the last best chance for his rivals to slow him down before Super Tuesday next week, when 12 states will vote. We asked New York Times political reporters what they would be looking for in the Republican debate._______Mr. Trump is clearly sensitive about the charge from his rivals that he cannot win support from a majority of Republican voters. I’m curious whether he will do anything in the debate to appear like a leader who can unify the party and appeal more broadly to the different Republican factions. Is he capable of elevating his debate performance and appearing more presidential, or will be continue to act like the toughest guy on the stage? — Patrick Healy_______Marco Rubio’s path to the nomination is so treacherous at this stage that he can’t just have a good debate, or even a really good debate. He has to have the biggest night of his campaign, cutting Mr. Trump down to size, inflicting real damage on Ted Cruz and showing Republican voters that Mr. Rubio is both angry and sane enough to be their standard-bearer. — Michael Barbaro_______Mr. Trump is entering the debate with three straight victories under his belt. If Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio can’t find ways to have breakout moments that will propel them into Super Tuesday, it’s hard to see what will stop Mr. Trump. — Maggie Haberman_______Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has spent recent days insisting he still has a place in the Republican field, even as Mr. Rubio’s campaign says he has no viable way to win the nomination. While Mr. Kasich proudly talks about forgoing attacks on other candidates, he said this week that America is not electing a “class president.” I’ll be watching to see what he says about his rivals and how he tries to justify his continued existence in the race. — Thomas Kaplan_______It’s no coincidence that the debate is in Houston, with Texas offering the biggest haul of delegates for Super Tuesday. Mr. Cruz’s back is to the wall in his home state. After his third-place finish in conservative South Carolina, his entire strategy of sweeping the South — where seven more states vote on March 1 — is on the line. Does he have a new way of taking on Trump? He’d better, because his earlier attacks, that Trump is not consistently conservative and is temperamentally unfit for the presidency, have not made a dent. — Trip Gabriel_______It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio train their fire on each other or on Mr. Trump. I also wonder if Mr. Trump will deliver a lackluster performance now that Jeb Bush, his favorite foil, is no longer on the stage. — Alan Rappeport_______As Mr. Trump stacks up victories, should Mr. Cruz bother with Mr. Rubio anymore? That’s the question some Cruz allies are asking, as their candidate continues to hammer his Senate colleague — potentially drowning out his more urgent attacks against Mr. Trump. On Thursday, we’ll see if Mr. Cruz thinks he can still afford to tussle on two fronts. — Matt Flegenheimer_______Beginning with the first debate, Mr. Bush played a central role in the action. Depending on the moment, he was an awkward combatant, a former governor and a policy wonk. Will his absence provide a slim opening for John Kasich, as the last remaining governor, to make his case? — Steve Eder_______Mr. Trump so far has seen Mr. Cruz as his biggest threat, largely letting Mr. Rubio skate by. It will be interesting to see if, after back-to-back, one-two finishes, Mr. Trump finally decides to take on the Florida senator, and whether he can land an attack against Mr. Rubio, who is a nimble debater. — Ashley Parker
