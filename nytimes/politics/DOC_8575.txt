Two days after Syrian government forces shelled a rebel-held suburb of the capital, Damascus, killing at least 40 people in a market, according to antigovernment activists, caged prisoners, said to be former army officers from the president’s sect, were displayed on the streets there, apparently to shield the area from further bombardment.The threat was conveyed in video clips and photographs posted on social networks under the hashtag “Cages of Protection,” which offered the macabre spectacle of male and female prisoners being driven through the streets of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus.According to Baraa Abdulrahman, a media activist close to the Army of Islam, the dominant rebel group in the region, the prisoners were captured army officers from President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite sect and their families. The captives were being placed in dozens of cages on rooftops and in streets throughout the rebel-controlled territory “so they can taste our misery,” Mr. Abdulrahman said in one of the video clips published online Sunday.“Human rights and humanitarian organizations will start calling on the opposition to release those officers,” the activist added, standing alongside one cage. “We didn’t hear those organizations calling to save the people of Eastern Ghouta.”Although there was no direct claim of responsibility for the stunt from the Army of Islam, it is the most powerful insurgent faction in the area, and it seems unlikely that the media activists couls have paraded the hostages with the group’s assent.The rebel group is thought to be holding captives seized as front lines around the capital have shifted over the past two years. It was impossible to tell from the visual evidence shared online, however, how many hostages were deployed across the region or if the public display might have been a show intended to sway public opinion against further bombardment of the region by government forces and their Russian allies.Mr. Abdulrahman, who uses a nom de guerre for security, used shock tactics in previous videos intended to draw the world’s attention to government airstrikes that have killed scores of people in the area. In February, he staged a propaganda message that self-consciously echoed an Islamic State video in which a caged Jordanian pilot, in an orange jumpsuit, was burned alive.In that clip, the activist appealed for help from the outside world by speaking to the camera about the strikes while standing in front of a cage filled with neighborhood children dressed in orange. After waving a torch, Mr. Abdulrahman asked why the killing of the pilot had prompted global condemnation while the deaths of children in Douma had passed almost unremarked on.The new propaganda videos featured interviews with hostages in the cages who demanded that the Assad government stop the bombardment of the area and negotiate their release. It was very unlikely that, given their situation, any of those interviewed by the activists or local journalists from channels that support the rebellion felt they could speak freely.“I hope the regime and the Russian jets stop the bombardment,” said one female prisoner identified as being originally from the president’s hometown. While the male prisoners appeared to be members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma, suggested that some of the women appeared to be Sunni Muslims.The Army of Islam, a group with financial backing from Saudi Arabia, is led by Zahran Alloush, a Sunni commander who seemed to back away from sectarian anti-Alawite statements in an interview with an American journalist, Roy Gutman, in May.Mr. Alloush, who said his faction had been in direct contact with Daniel Rubinstein, the Obama administration’s special envoy for Syria, told Mr. Gutman that “coexistence with minorities” was part of a long Syrian tradition.“We are not seeking to impose our power on minorities or to practice oppression against them,” Mr. Alloush said. “On the contrary, we have always criticized the regime and fought it because it was practicing sectarian discrimination against the majority.”Alawites from the Assad family have ruled Syria for decades, even though most Syrians are Sunnis.Although the Army of Islam made no claim responsibility, the Islamist group was widely suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of Razan Zeitouneh, a human rights lawyer, along with her husband and two other secular opposition activists in Douma in late 2013.The rebel stronghold of Eastern Ghouta has been under intense bombardment since the insurgents managed to block the main northern entrance to Damascus and threatened the road of the international airport. The area around the airport has been the scene of intense fighting in recent days and airstrikes that the rebels suspect were carried out by Russian warplanes.“It’s to protect the civilians,” Bilal Abu Salah, a media activist from Douma, said in a Skype interview on Sunday.A paramedic from Douma who asked to be identified only by his first name, Ahmad, said the casualties of the recent strikes there “were women and kids mostly.”Ahmad, who took part in a demonstration by medical workers outside a local hospital calling for a cease-fire some months ago, said he saw the cages filled with prisoners on Sunday.“They were roaming all around the city,” he said. “It won’t work. The air force that targets civilian neighborhoods and marketplaces won’t care if there were hostages.”One of the hostages, who identified himself on video as a colonel captured more than three years ago, shouted, “Enough bloodshed and enough fighting ourselves.”“Let’s solve our problems with our hands,” he added, “away from these Russians you brought to our country.”The images, and accompanying sectarian rhetoric, provoked revulsion from many observers, including a Syrian activist staunchly opposed to the Assad government, Rami Jarrah, who helped document the first protests in Damascus in 2011.Mohammad Hasan, another media activist from Douma, expressed his support for the tactic.“Hopefully the Russians will stop bombing us,” he said. “You can’t imagine what we witnessed during the last two days. I survived a rocket attack yesterday that landed right beside me. Two women were close to the rocket. They were torn in pieces.”The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, run by a British-based expatriate with connections to opposition activists, said the Sunni Islamist group had copied the strategy of using “kidnapped people — including whole families — as human shields,” seen earlier in Alawite-majority towns seeking to deter shelling by insurgents.
