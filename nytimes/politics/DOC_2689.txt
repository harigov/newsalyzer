George Balanchine’s pure dance masterpiece “Jewels” explores three facets of ballet: “Emeralds” evokes France; “Rubies” captures an angular, energetic midcentury American modernism; and “Diamonds” conjures the courtly grandeur of imperial Russian classicism.Several performances commemorating the work’s 50th anniversary at next summer’s Lincoln Center Festival will take that internationalism to a new level: The festival plans to bring together the Paris Opera Ballet, New York City Ballet and the Bolshoi Ballet to dance “Jewels.”Their collaboration — for five performances at the David H. Koch Theater, July 20 to July 23 — is to be announced on Wednesday at a 10 a.m. news conference on Facebook Live featuring representatives from all three companies.At the opening night performance on July 20, the Paris Opera Ballet will dance “Emeralds,” which is set to music by Fauré; New York City Ballet will dance “Rubies,” set to Stravinsky; and the Bolshoi Ballet will dance “Diamonds,” set to Tchaikovsky. In later performances, City Ballet and the Bolshoi will trade off “Rubies” and “Diamonds.”The work — a pure dance three-act ballet — was created for City Ballet, which danced its premiere on April 13, 1967, and has gone on to be danced by other companies around the nation and the world.The cross-company Lincoln Center performance will use the sets from the current City Ballet production by Peter Harvey, but each company will wear costumes from its own production: The City Ballet dancers will wear Karinska’s original costume designs; the Bolshoi dancers will wear costumes by Elena Zaitseva; and the Parisians will wear costumes by Christian Lacroix. Casting, and the rest of the festival, will be announced later.
