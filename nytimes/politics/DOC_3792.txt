If so, what happened, and how did you feel?Describe your thoughts and opinions about ever-present video cameras and their usage. When are public cameras acceptable, and when does the recording make you uncomfortable or cross a line?In “In China, Daydreaming Students Are Caught on Camera,” Javier C. Hernandez writes:Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:— Do you think having classroom surveillance makes students, or teachers, behave differently? If so, how? If surveillance changes behavior, is the change an improvement? Why or why not?— Are there cameras in your classroom? Would you mind if you and your classmates were live-streamed so others could watch while you learned? Why or why not?— What might be lost, or gained, when students and teachers work under daily camera surveillance?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.
