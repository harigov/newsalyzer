MEXICO CITY — A Cuban man convicted in the United States of spying on behalf of Cuba can stay in Cuba, where he was allowed to go last month for his father’s funeral, if he renounces his American citizenship, a federal judge ruled Friday.The man, René González, 56, has been in Cuba since April 22. He was due to return to Florida because the Justice Department had required that he serve out his three years of probation in the United States. Mr. González was released from prison in October 2011 after serving 13 years.But federal prosecutors recently reversed their stance, telling Judge Joan Lenard of United States District Court in Miami that “the F.B.I. has concluded that the security interests of the United States are furthered if the defendant, while already in Cuba, is allowed to voluntarily renounce his United States citizenship and thereafter does not return to the United States.”Mr. González told The Associated Press in Havana that being allowed to stay in Cuba with his wife and two daughters was “a great relief.”Cuban officials, who have long complained about the case, did not respond to an e-mail.Some experts said the decision could pave the way for a new round of conversations between Cuba and the United States about the case of Alan Gross, an American contractor who has been held in Cuba since 2009 for bringing illegal telecommunications equipment to the island.Cuba has maintained that Mr. González and his four co-defendants, who are known as the Cuban Five and have been considered heroes in Cuba since they were charged in 1998, would need to be released in order for Mr. Gross to be released.American officials have rejected such a trade, insisting that the cases not be linked, leading to a diplomatic logjam.
