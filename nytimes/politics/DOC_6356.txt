BEIRUT, Lebanon —  Airstrikes by the American-led coalition against Islamic State militants have killed several dozen people in northern Syria, with the death toll from Friday’s attacks rising to more than 52 civilians on Saturday, according to a Syrian monitoring group and local activists.The attacks on the village of Bir Mahli, in Aleppo Province, east of the Euphrates River, killed at least nine children, said the group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain and monitors the violence in Syria through a network of contacts inside the country.Since September, the United States and allied countries have been conducting airstrikes in Syria and Iraq against militants of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL.According to the tallies of airstrikes that the United States Central Command routinely releases, there were several in “the area of” Kobani, a town near the Turkish border, north of Bir Mahli, that were said to have hit Islamic State positions, vehicles and “tactical units.”“We have no information to corroborate allegations that coalition airstrikes resulted in civilian casualties,” Capt. John J. Moore said in an email. “Regardless, we take all allegations seriously and will look into them further.”A local Kurdish activist, Perwer Mohammad Ali, confirmed that civilians had been killed in strikes on Bir Mahli on Friday. He said that while many Kurds had fled the ethnically mixed villages since the militants arrived in the area, some Arab civilians still lived in the village.The Observatory said that members of at least six families were killed, along with some Islamic State fighters, and that 13 were missing.
