LOMBARDÍA, Mexico —  They have been hailed as saviors, vigilantes marching into town with military-style rifles and submachine guns, wearing no uniforms and threatening to whip miscreants as they bring order to this lawless Mexican region known as Tierra Caliente, or hot lands.But now some of the residents who welcomed the vigilantes’ populist brand of justice, even giving them money to buy weapons, are growing anxious that these self-declared protectors may end up becoming predators themselves.“They are all the same,” a prominent lime grower here said of the criminals and the vigilantes who have chased them out. Many of the businessmen and residents who have contributed to the vigilantes, he said, were intimidated into doing so “because they have arms.”As the government exults over the capture last weekend of one of the world’s most wanted drug kingpins — Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as “El Chapo,” or Shorty — the rise of vigilante groups in lawless corners of western Mexico show the pressing, and some analysts contend, deeper security challenges that remain.As they advance town by town, chasing out a powerful criminal gang, the vigilantes have cast a glaring spotlight on the government’s inability to secure stretches of its own territory. Calling themselves self-defense forces, the vigilantes have even forced Mexican officials to recognize and work with them, creating a fragile pact between the government and heavily armed fighters with uncertain loyalties.The growth of such forces “exposes the weaknesses of the rule of law and the real inability of state security institutions to develop robust responses,” said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.The criminal gang that terrorized this part of Mexico is known as the Knights Templar, and like the self-defense groups, it, too, began with the stated goal of ending the criminal stranglehold on the region.But it became a large criminal organization itself, killing with impunity, raping women and girls and systemically collecting “dues” from taco vendors, shopkeepers and larger businesses.Fed up with the rampant violence, police corruption and seeming indifference of federal officials, a group of local businessmen has channeled tens of thousands of dollars to a ragtag group of vigilantes made up of farmers, townspeople and lately, to the consternation of many here, even some former members of the brutal criminal gang they are battling.To arm the local fighters, the businessmen delivered a large sum of money to the group for assault-style rifles and trucks in Texas, one local mango producer said. But after contributing about $30,000 of his own money, he said he was not giving any more, worried that the former gang members now working with local residents could not be trusted.“I don’t like that,” said the mango producer, whose role in financing the groups was confirmed by local clergymen. “I think they are still giving info” to the criminals.The uncertain makeup of the vigilantes has cast a shadow over the Mexican government’s thorny relationship with them and fed internal divisions among the groups themselves. At first, federal officials called on the self-defense groups to disarm, saying that armed vigilantes with no law-enforcement training or accountability would only inflame the volatile situation here in the state of Michoacán, a center of instability in Mexico.Then, as federal forces moved in to disarm the vigilantes last month, they were blocked by protesters and ended up killing three local residents, prompting broad complaints that the government was going after the very citizens it had failed to protect in the first place.Now, as new groups pop up in a few other states, the government is trying to incorporate the vigilantes into a so-called rural defense force that would patrol in conjunction with the federal police and the military. This, the government has argued, will weed out bad apples and bring the groups under some measure of state control.But this month, Mexico’s newly appointed federal commissioner for Michoacán, Alfredo Castillo, was photographed at a meeting with vigilantes, including a man the government had identified as a major drug trafficker. Mr. Castillo later told reporters that he did not know about the man’s past.“It was only a matter of time something like this would happen,” said Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence officer who argues that legitimizing the vigilantes without fully knowing their backgrounds takes the focus off building reliable state law-enforcement institutions.The government has registered several hundred members of the self-defense forces, asking them to report what weapons they have. The groups claim as many as 20,000 members and keep no records of the pistols and the illegal assault-style rifles and submachine guns their members carry openly in the streets.Last week, the unified front presented by the self-defense groups fractured, with one faction criticizing another for allowing former members of the gang to join, and promising an internal cleansing to chase out undesirables.After they took this small town earlier this month along with several others, the vigilantes played a profanity-laced ballad known as a corrido written in their honor.“Michoacános,” the singer cried out, “always be alert and well armed...”“To the drug addicts and those smoking ice,” or methamphetamine, “we are going to give them 15 lashes with a hose!” a leader known as Commander Beto shouted to residents.For all the cheering, some supporters and residents are growing uneasy with the citizen soldiers, especially after a decision to let presumed low-ranking members of the criminal gang into the fold if they swear allegiance to the self-defense forces and if self-appointed representatives of the town decide to pardon them.“I am worried about letting the lookouts in because what they do is report to the Knights Templar what is going on,” Raul Jimenez, a rice farmer, said in a near whisper as he watched the vigilantes’ presentation. “God says forgive, but what if they turn on us? For now we need the self-defense group, but I am worried.”Many of these new recruits, typically former lookouts and informants for the gang, are young men and boys who as punishment for their deeds must help build sandbag barricades at checkpoints and take late-night and early-morning shifts guarding them.“See you tomorrow night here for your night guard shift,” Otoniel Jiménez, a vigilante group member, called out to a boy no older than 13, as preparations were made to keep watch over another town, Los Reyes. “And don’t drink tonight!”With a grin, the boy called back, “I won’t, I promise.”For many supporters, concerns about membership and weapons must be brushed aside for the sake of keeping the peace.America Alvarez, who six months ago fled to the United States from Nueva Italia after extortion and death threats, said she sent $100 a week to the vigilantes in her town, even though she has wondered if undesirables are in the group.“It has crossed my mind, but my despair is way bigger than that fear,” she said by phone. “All my family is still there, and someone has to protect them.”Still, a longtime business woman in Nueva Italia says concerns about the group are spreading.“It is not logical to see them in the past behaving wrongly and now just believe all of a sudden they won’t, and even more, that they will now serve us,” she said, speaking anonymously, like many others, for fear of reprisals.Some vigilante leaders said the concerns were overblown. They said most of their matériel came from Knights Templar hide-outs they have overrun, and that much of the money came from members who diverted their farming and business profits to the cause.Estanislao Beltrán, a leader known as Papa Smurf for his long beard and blue plaid shirts, said he was unaware of any gun purchases in the United States. Another leader, Hípolito Mora, said no guns were bought outside Mexico, although he conceded an untold number were acquired on Mexico’s black market.“In all of Tierra Caliente, you can buy these weapons,” he said.Outside Nueva Italia, a few vigilantes sat next to a shop, meticulously taking apart and cleaning assault-style rifles a block from where federal police officers were bivouacked.Mr. Beltrán said criminals have been found only occasionally in the groups, and that they have been asked to leave. He and others noted that the government effort to regularize them as a rural defense force required them to submit to a criminal-background check.Salvador Alvarez, a vigilante leader in Los Reyes, proudly showed off his registration papers, with boxes for “revolver” and “long arm” checked. He said he had served jail time for marijuana possession in the United States. But as long as members have not committed serious crimes, he said, the government should not ask too many questions.“Whether in the rural defense force or in self-defense,” he said, “I will keep protecting my community.”
