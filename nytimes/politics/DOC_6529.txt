A “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton will begin airing ads in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania that tether Donald J. Trump to embattled Republican senators there.The group, Priorities USA, will run ads in the Manchester, N.H., and Philadelphia markets, as Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania face difficult re-election battles.The move is a new phase for Priorities. Mrs. Clinton’s lead over Mr. Trump has allowed the group to focus on down-ballot races.This week it will also begin airing television and radio ads in Georgia, a reliably Republican-leaning state that polls show may be in play in the presidential race.“Our first priority is doing all we can to help Hillary win in as many places, among as many people and by as big a margin as possible,” Guy Cecil, the chief strategist for Priorities, said in an emailed statement. But Mr. Cecil, the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the group hopes to add to the ranks of Democrats working with her in Congress.
