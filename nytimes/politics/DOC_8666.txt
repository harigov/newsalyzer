Arab League foreign ministers on Thursday condemned what they called the “shameful” abduction of at least 26 Qatari hunters one week ago in a remote part of southern Iraq near the Saudi Arabian border. The hunters, who included some senior members of Qatar’s royalty, were seized by unidentified gunmen, and there has been no word on their whereabouts or the demands — if any — made by the kidnappers. In a statement reported by Qatar’s official news agency, the Arab League foreign ministers, meeting in Cairo, expressed “full solidarity” with Qatar’s government in efforts to secure the release of the hunters, who had entered Iraq legally. Their uncertain fate has strained relations between Sunni-dominated Qatar and the Shiite-led government of Iraq, amid speculation that Shiite militia members in southern Iraq may have been responsible. Iraq’s foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jafari, has denied suggestions that his government had anything to do with the abduction. “There are security flaws that we must acknowledge, and our enemies exploited the security shortcomings,” Mr. Jafari said.
