Late last week, the summer bucket list of a highly ambitious Pittsburgh teenager was reportedly discovered in an Urban Outfitters dressing room. Some items, written in green marker, include: “buy 7 bikinis,” “pet a giraffe,” “go ape” and “get drunk all the time.” (N.B.: The last one was completed as of the list’s discovery.)Today, we discovered another summer bucket list, this one tucked into an empty Everlane box and mistakenly placed in a recycling bin marked “cans and bottles only.” It appears to be written by a woman in her mid-thirties.
