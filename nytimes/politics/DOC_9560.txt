NODEIRINHO, Portugal — Constantino Gracieta and his wife were among the lucky ones. At first, they got in their car and tried to escape the advancing flames that swept across a vast, dry forest in central Portugal over the weekend.But finding the road that cuts through their hamlet, Mosteiro, engulfed by fire, they turned back and began to hose down their house instead.“People fought to save their houses,” Mr. Gracieta said. “I knew that, with the road completely cut and the whole forest on fire, firefighters were never going to get here quick enough to help us.”At least 64 people were not as fortunate, perishing in the wildfire, many of them while in their cars trying to flee. With 135 people injured, the authorities warned that the death toll could still rise from the fire, which started on Saturday, apparently ignited by lightning strikes.Driving from Porto in the north on Monday, I entered a ravaged landscape of blackened ground that exhaled smoke and seemed to be struggling for breath. Every few miles, I passed burned-out carcasses of cars on the side of the road. In what remained of a door frame, fresh pink flowers were laid in tribute to one car’s victims.As I approached signposts on secondary roads, they offered their own testament to the extent of the disaster: Many had been melted by the heat.Already, the fatalities have made the wildfire the worst in half a century in a small country where deadly blazes have become increasingly severe and routine, as longstanding land management problems collide with changes in climate that produce hotter, drier summers.On Monday, crews were still struggling to tame the deadly blaze in central Portugal, even as more than 2,000 firefighters battled separate fires around the country amid strong winds and scorching temperatures.Given those circumstances and the country’s history, some were already beginning to question why Portugal had not done more sooner to improve its land practices and fire-warning systems, and whether the authorities did enough to inform people trying to escape the blaze.“I understand that it’s very hard to control such a fire, but I don’t understand why it’s so hard to coordinate the movement of people,” said Aires Henriques, who ended up driving for several hours along back roads to circumvent the fire area.He and his wife, Maria Lourdes, were driving home on Saturday afternoon to their village of Troviscais from Porto when a friend called to warn them about the blaze. The police stopped them on IC8, the road that crosses this area, and told them to take another route, without specifying which one.While he knows the area well, he said, “we’ve got tourists and others who probably had no idea where they were going.”For now, an atmosphere of national tragedy and mourning stifled much of the impulse for finger-pointing. Portugal’s political parties for the most part heeded a call by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to first deal with the emergency before discussing its circumstances.“Now is the time for the authorities to act, not the time for politicians,” Pedro Passos Coelho, leader of the main center-right opposition party, said over the weekend.Once the flames have been extinguished, however, there will no doubt be an investigation into why so many victims apparently died after finding themselves cut off, encircled by fire and stranded along roads they took while trying to flee by car.Around the Pedrógão Grande area, several residents said they were largely left to their own devices in terms of working out whether to drive off — and where to.As roads got cut off, firefighters, too, struggled to reach isolated hamlets. In Mosteiro, for instance, residents said firefighters — who had traveled from the city of Porto de Mós, about an hour’s drive away — arrived long after the fire had already crossed the hamlet.Manuel Nunes, who walks with a crutch, said he survived probably because his leg made him decide to stay put. He watched from his home as the flames crossed Nodeirinho. “I cannot describe what happened here,” he said.In Nodeirinho, an area dotted with orchards and olive groves, and surrounded by a vast forest, 11 people — about a quarter of the hamlet’s inhabitants — perished in the flames.There and in other small villages, survivors gathered on Monday outside their houses, looking at one another dazed, struggling to come to terms with this tragedy.“You survive a fire tornado, something terrifying, but then you start later to realize that your relatives and friends died in their car, outside their home or wherever,” Silva Céu, a teacher, said. “There are no words for how I feel.”Ms. Céu survived by staying inside her home as the fire, fickle in dispatching its fate, raced through the hamlet, burning down some houses, mainly on its edges, but leaving others intact.Susana da Costa, a cleaner who lives in Luxembourg, normally returns to spend vacations in her family home near Nodeirinho. On Monday morning, she returned not to relax but to survey her home, and she was unable to muster the courage to see if it was in ruins, as she feared. Her husband’s grandmother was one of those who died, she said.“One day you have everything here that you love, and the next you’ve got nothing left,” she said, holding back tears.As he saw the fire advancing, António Dios dos Santos made a desperate bid to save his mule, Carissa. He crossed a field and reached his barn but could not open the doors because the barn was already engulfed in flames.“It was just a huge ring of fire, complete hell,” he said. “We, of course, all care about people dying, but she really was my companion.”Around the town of Pedrógão Grande, firefighters were trying to put out the last pockets of fire on Monday, with the support of firefighting planes, amid fears that the dry weather conditions could easily rekindle the flames.Maintenance workers were removing fallen road signs, as well as electricity and phone lines dangling across secondary roads. Volunteers and charity workers were crisscrossing the region in minivans, delivering water and food to the residents who survived the weekend inferno.At a gas station, a group of firefighters sat next to their vehicles, visibly exhausted. “This is just a very, very, very big tragedy,” one of them said.Arsonists have been blamed for many of Portugal’s recent fires. But on Sunday, Portugal’s police chief concluded that the blaze had “very clearly” started from natural causes, probably the result of a dry thunderstorm, in which there are lightning strikes but no rainfall.Such a weather phenomenon does occur in Portugal, but generally only in the final stages of the summer, after months of very hot weather, according to experts.While climate change may help explain the severity and speed of the weekend blaze, environmentalists also said it reflected longstanding forest management issues.A significant problem, some environmentalists said, has been the proliferation of the planting of eucalyptus trees for profit, to be farmed for paper pulp. Eucalyptus offers a far quicker return on investment after its plantation than pine and many other kinds of wood. But it also contains flammable oil.The surface area covered by eucalyptus trees has more than doubled in Portugal since the 1980s. Eucalyptus is now the most grown tree in the country, covering about 26 percent of forested land, ahead of cork oak, whose exports have long formed a pillar of Portugal’s economy. Some environmentalists said the fire showed the need for a cap.Further fire dangers, they said, have been caused by socioeconomic changes in Portugal, with an aging and dwindling farming population migrating to cities and coastal areas, leaving much land dangerously untended.In the aftermath of other recent fire disasters, Portugal’s Parliament started to debate last year an overhaul of its forestry laws.Among proposed changes, the Socialist government wants to identify clearly the owners of forest land, in a country where about 92 percent of forests are in private hands. The change would also set up a system of fines for owners deemed to be neglecting their trees.“We have a country where we often don’t know which land belongs to whom,” said Miguel Bugalho, a university researcher on forest ecology and a forest and biodiversity adviser to the World Wildlife Fund in Portugal.In some regions of Portugal, he added, “we face a situation of complete abandonment of the forest.”
