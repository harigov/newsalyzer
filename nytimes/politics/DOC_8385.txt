After investigating complaints of widespread sexual misconduct by guards in an immigration detention center in Texas for women and children, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security found no evidence of abuse, according to a report published Friday.The complaints filed last fall were about a detention center in Karnes City, southeast of San Antonio, which holds about 500 women and their children who were caught crossing the Southwest border illegally. Detainees claimed that male guards were leading women to the laundry room after hours to have sex, and guards had given money or favors to female detainees for sex.In one case, a guard was said to have rented an apartment for a detainee after she was released, and one detainee was said to have become pregnant by a guard.In his report, the inspector general, John Roth, said investigators found “no evidence” to prove the allegations and were “unable to identify a victim or suspect in this matter.”But an examination of surveillance video from the laundry room revealed that two guards who were in a “romantic relationship” had engaged in “inappropriate physical contact” there. Both resigned after questioning about the incident, said Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees immigration detention. The Karnes center is run by the GEO Group, a private prison administrator.The inspector general said 33 witnesses were questioned. All women denied having sex with guards, and the woman said to be pregnant “voluntarily submitted” to a test, which was negative. Investigators examined the detainee’s commissary accounts and found no evidence of deposits by guards, according to the report.The complaints were part of a bitter confrontation between Obama administration officials and advocates for the migrants over the prolonged detention of women and children, many of them caught during the surge in South Texas last summer.Advocates said many of the women were fleeing gang violence and domestic abuse in their home countries in Central America and should be released while their petitions for asylum move through the courts.Ranjana Natarajan, a University of Texas law professor who represents some migrants at Karnes, said she was skeptical because it was not clear that the witnesses had felt safe to speak without fear of reprisal in their asylum cases.“What is the government doing to ensure that sexual abuse is prevented in the future?” she said.Ms. Christensen hailed the report, saying it showed the immigration agency was “committed to providing a safe and secure environment” for detainees.The administration has been rapidly expanding detention of women and children, opening another large center in Dilley, Tex., in December.
