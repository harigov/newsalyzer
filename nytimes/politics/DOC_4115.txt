Correction AppendedThe nation's four biggest cigarette makers and officials of eight states have reached agreement on the outlines of a settlement designed to resolve all remaining state claims over health costs related to smoking, attorneys general and industry lawyers involved in the talks said yesterday.The plan, drafted to cover the 46 states that have not already made individual settlements with the industry, would cost the tobacco companies $206 billion over 25 years and would restrict cigarette advertising and marketing.It would eliminate the industry's most significant financial and legal threat: state suits seeking to recover the Medicaid costs of treating people with smoking-related illnesses.The plan would cost the industry far less than a $368.5 billion agreement with state attorneys general last year that eventually grew into a $516 billion bill in Congress under which the Federal Government would also have gained regulatory authority over nicotine.Unlike the earlier state proposal, this new plan does not shield tobacco companies from punitive damages and class-action liability suits.If companies finance the plan's cost by raising cigarette prices, the cost of a pack would increase 35 cents over the next five years, though some makers might, for competitive reasons, choose to raise prices less and absorb the cost themselves.Under the plan, which is expected to be completed today and announced as early as Monday, the producers have agreed to an array of marketing restrictions like a ban on billboard and transit advertisements as well as the sale of clothing and merchandise with brand logos.The proposal also calls for cigarette makers to pay $1.45 billion over the next five years to finance smoking-cessation programs and advertisements to counter under-age tobacco use.Producers will pay an additional $25 million a year over the next decade for a foundation that will research ways to reduce youth smoking. They will also pledge not to market to those under 18.''We have reached an agreement on all the issues,'' said Christine A. Gregoire, the Washington State Attorney General. ''We are in the final drafting stage and hope to have a settlement sometime Saturday.''Last-minute disputes could delay or derail the settlement, but those involved said they did not consider such problems likely. Once the eight states and the companies agree, the plan will be sent to officials of the other 38 states that have lawsuits pending or have yet to file one.Those states will have about one week to join; under its current terms, the plan would take effect once states representing about 80 percent of the nation's Medicaid population sign on.Because the plan is designed to be a national settlement, the tobacco companies could withdraw if too few  states join. If enough states join for the plan to take effect, but some states do not participate, its cost would be reduced proportionately.The tobacco industry was first struck by state lawsuits seeking to recover Medicaid money spent treating people with smoking-related illnesses in 1994. As anticipation of a final settlement grew over recent weeks, the stocks of cigarette makers have risen on Wall Street.If completed, the plan would represent the largest settlement of civil lawsuits in United States history.In large part, it would effectively codify on a national level marketing and advertising concessions made by the industry over the past year in settling smoking-related lawsuits brought by four states, Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas. The national counteradvertising campaign and the new foundation would expand on those agreements.The participating producers are the Philip Morris Companies; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the Loews Corporation, and Brown & Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C.Tobacco industry lawyers agreed yesterday that the five-month-old talks had reached a final stage.''The parties have finished their negotiations and they are reviewing final versions of the papers,'' said  Arthur F. Golden, a lawyer representing RJR Nabisco.The plan does not contain legal protections for cigarette makers and does not require Congressional approval.The proposal also does not contain restrictions on fees for plaintiffs' lawyers who were hired by state attorneys general to pursue those claims, which are to be paid by the industry in addition to the plan's costs and are expected to total billions more.But the industry would not have to pay more than $500 million in fees in any one year, a cigarette company lawyer said.Along with Ms. Gregoire, attorneys general of the seven other states involved in the talks -- California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania -- are expected to announce the plan on Monday.The majority of the remaining 38 states are expected to join. But some states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin, have previously pressed for stronger public health provisions. And officials of some states have been discussing the possibility of wringing greater concessions from producers.''A number of us are very definitely undecided,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General.Anti-smoking advocates did not participate in crafting the proposal and their reactions yesterday varied.''The more we know about the agreement, the more we know it is not a comprehensive national plan,'' said Matthew Myers, a lawyer for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group.Ms. Gregoire, the state official, said that she understood that the plan would face criticism, but that attorneys general had a legal duty to measure what could be achieved inside and outside the courtroom.Industry lawyers said they would not complete the agreement until a specified number of states agreed to the accord. They have declined to disclose that figure, but a document posted yesterday by The Arizona Republic on its Internet site and described by the newspaper as a draft summary of the plan states that participating states must account for at least 80 percent of the total settlement for it to become final.Under a formula developed by the attorneys general, each state will receive a part of the settlement based on factors like its percentage of the nation's Medicaid population. The plan's value would also be proportionally reduced if it goes forward but some states do not join it.A spokesman for Attorney General Dennis Vacco of New York confirmed published reports that the state would receive some $20 billion under the plan.Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General, said his state would receive $2 billion to $3 billion.It is not clear whether Federal officials who provide Medicaid money to the states will seek to claim a share of the settlement or try to restrict how money can be spent.The proposal comes as something of an anticlimax to a lengthy national debate over smoking.Last year, the industry and state attorneys general agreed to a $368.5 billion settlement under which cigarette makers agreed to marketing restrictions, to Federal regulation of nicotine and to other measures in return for legal protections against smoking-related lawsuits.That plan mushroomed earlier this year into the $516 billion tobacco bill sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. But the bill, which would have raised the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack and cut the legal protections sought by producers, ran into industry opposition and collapsed.As a result, a new round of settlement talks began five months ago between industry officials and states to reach an agreement that would not require Congressional approval.If it resolves the state claims, the industry would erase its biggest legal challenge. But it continues to face lawsuits from others, like individual smokers and trade unions.None of the state lawsuits have ever been resolved by a jury. Of the four cases settled, Minnesota's advanced furthest in trial, but was settled on the eve of a jury decision. The State of Washington's lawsuit is under way but will be resolved if the settlement goes forward.Under the new plan, participating states would receive about the same amount of money as their share in the failed $368.5 billion accord. (Only about $196 billion of the $368.5 billion would have gone to the states, with the remainder going to the Federal government to settle class-action suits.)But the plan is not as rich as the $6.1 billion deal Minnesota won in May.As a result of that settlement, producers also increased their payments to Florida, Mississippi and Texas, bringing the total of the payments to the four states over 25 years to some $40 billion.Producers also agreed under the new plan to avoid cartoon figures in advertisements, to ban sponsorship of youth-oriented sporting events and concerts and to refrain from lobbying against state initiatives that make it harder for under-age smokers to buy cigarettes.Also, producers would be able to sponsor one sporting event using the brand name of a cigarette.A spokesman for Ms. Gregoire said she was holding settlement discussions with the smokeless tobacco producer U.S. Tobacco, a subsidiary of UST Inc., and expected them to conclude shortly.Correction: January 14, 2005, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the inauguration of the Washington State governor, whose election is being contested, misstated her initial.
