In contrast with the early stumbles in most of the country, New York State, almost from the start, has provided a textbook lesson in how to make the Affordable Care Act work. But it has done so by making some tough decisions.New York has signed up more than 900,000 people for commercial or government plans, lured 16 insurance companies onto its exchange, provided subsidies for most customers and reduced premiums across the board.“I have to say that on the whole this is a very savvy bunch of people they have operating the exchange,” Mark P. Scherzer, a lawyer and consumer advocate, said. “It really is a story of something that government could actually do right.”The state’s success was no accident. It began with a receptive customer base and the benefit of experience, since New York already had some of the country’s most generous insurance coverage for the poor and sick. Resistance to the health exchange among Republicans in the state may, oddly enough, have helped make it more successful.But New York also took some aggressive and unpopular steps that few other states have taken, by creating a highly centralized system limiting consumer choice, essentially giving insurance seekers little incentive to shop off the exchange.As a result, most New Yorkers who are not insured through an employer are effectively barred from choosing any doctors or hospitals they want.At least 100,000 people have lost their old health plans because they did not conform to new federal requirements. Thousands more freelancers and other “sole proprietors” were barred from banding together for group insurance rates, a change in longstanding practice that almost certainly pushed more consumers to buy insurance on the exchange.Donna Frescatore, executive director of New York State of Health, as the exchange is called, said the state’s decisions had been vindicated by the fact that premium rates had dropped more than 50 percent from previous years.Individual premiums for Manhattan residents, for instance, dropped from $1,534 for a standard health maintenance organization, or H.M.O., in 2013 to $621 for a comparable exchange plan now. “I think it has in part ensured that customers have affordable options,” Ms. Frescatore said.Long before President Obama was elected, New York was a pioneer in requiring insurance companies to provide individual or small-group coverage to people regardless of existing illness, and to price it without regard to health, age, gender or occupation, core provisions of the Affordable Care Act.And while the federal law allows children to be covered under their parents’ policies until they turn 26, New York already required offering coverage up to 30, and still does.“So in those other states, you have health plans trying to figure it out,” said Peter Newell, an analyst for the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit research organization. “In New York, you could sidestep a lot of problems.”Still, the exchange had a rough start. Republicans in the State Senate tried to block it by refusing to support the creation of an independent authority to run it. New York could have followed 36 other states in simply joining the exchange set up by the federal government, whose numerous problems were not yet evident. Instead Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo established the state ’s exchange by executive order, deeding it to “seasoned stagehands,” as Mr. Newell put it, in the Health Department.About 508,000 of those who enrolled qualified for Medicaid and 63,000 for Child Health Plus, another government-subsidized plan; 363,000 bought private plans. The number who purchased private plans by March 31, the enrollment deadline for 2014 coverage, exceeded federal government predictions for New York by more than 60 percent. Nationwide, thanks to a last-minute surge, 7.1 million people signed up for private plans by the end of March, allowing the Obama administration to hit its goal of 7 million.The Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research institution, has ranked New York’s exchange as the most competitive of seven states studied, based in part on the large number of companies participating and their relatively balanced market share.In an unusual decision that had a strong impact on consumer choices, New York required insurers to offer the same type of coverage on the exchange as off.The result was that none of New York’s insurers offered out-of-network coverage for individuals, except in a small part of western New York, because they wanted to hold down costs and avoid being swamped by sick people. So regardless of whether individuals buy their plans on the exchange or off, they cannot get coverage outside a fixed network of doctors and hospitals, even if they are willing to pay more for it.With no out-of-network coverage, “New York is a real outlier,” said Mr. Scherzer, who advocates more options. “But they did it in part because they thought it would keep premiums down, which of course it does,” he said.State officials say the decision served to level the playing field for insurance companies and consumers. But it has led to complaints from consumers who cannot go to the doctors or hospitals they want.The sickest customers tend to be the most upset, like Abigail List, a 53-year-old therapist in Manhattan, who said she had to choose one of the most expensive plans, costing $300 more a month than others, so she could have coverage for her longtime cancer doctors at NYU-Langone Medical Center. “I’m being railroaded, that’s why I’m so furious,” Ms. List said.The most prestigious and specialized hospitals tend to take the fewest plans on the exchange. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the renowned cancer hospital, takes only two exchange plans for individuals, Health Republic and Oscar.“It’s fairly difficult to take the pricing that some of the other insurers on the exchanges are proposing,” said John Gunn, the chief operating officer for Sloan-Kettering. “It was way below our cost of providing the service.”He said Sloan-Kettering was working with about 100 patients to make sure they had access to the hospital if they needed it, either by being in network or by special arrangement.Benjamin Lawsky, the state’s financial services superintendent, said that not requiring out-of-network coverage was strategic in the first year but was being reconsidered. “As we think about setting rates for Year Two, has the exchange matured enough that we think it’s wise to mandate an out-of-network benefit?” Mr. Lawsky said. “We’ll make that decision probably in the next few weeks.”The exchange also benefited from the state’s refusal to reinstate canceled plans when President Obama said it could; state officials said restoring the plans would have caused chaos by upsetting insurance pricing.The state’s rollout was not without snags. Its website was swamped on the first day but capacity was quadrupled over the next four days.Some doctors have complained that they are mistakenly listed in plans they do not accept, or have been cut from plans they would like to be on. Empire BlueCross BlueShield, overwhelmed by early sign-ups, agreed to pay cash penalties to about 20,000 customers who did not receive their insurance cards in time for coverage in January.But others were surprisingly willing to forgive the exchange its shortcomings.Marilyn Miller, a retired ballet dancer who now runs Pilates on Hudson in Peekskill, N.Y., had her old plan canceled. But she is happy that her new one covers regular doctor visits, and she is putting money into a health savings account in case she ever needs to see a specialist outside of her network.“It was well worth it to be able to get insurance and not have it tied to my business,” Ms. Miller said.Malka Percal, 63, a copy editor who lives in downtown Manhattan, lost her freelancer’s plan and her “really wonderful” doctor. But she likes the promise of universal health care. “Is it Pollyannaish of me?” she said. “I have a really hopeful feeling.”
