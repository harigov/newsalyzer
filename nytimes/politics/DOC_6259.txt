Benjamin T. Jealous, who led the N.A.A.C.P. through a tumultuous period for civil rights with a focus on technological change, will leave his job as president of the organization in January, he announced Sunday.Mr. Jealous, who became the organization’s youngest leader when he took over five years ago at age 35, said in an interview on Sunday that he had decided to spend more time with his family, and that he felt he had left the civil rights group in a strong position.“When people look back at this moment in N.A.A.C.P. history, they will see that we rose to the challenges of the 21st century,” he said. He cited a push toward organizing online and on cellphones, a doubling of revenue and a new influence at the polls.Mr. Jealous’s tenure was not without controversy. He condemned the Tea Party movement, saying it contained “racist elements.” And he criticized an Agriculture Department official, Shirley Sherrod, who had become a pariah of conservatives when a misleadingly edited video made it appear as though she sanctioned bias against white farmers. He later apologized for rushing to judgment.He now plans to teach and, he said, focus efforts on helping “black and Latino and other progressive candidates in the South and Southwest at state level. This could be the moment to really move the country forward.”
