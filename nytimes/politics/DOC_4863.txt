WASHINGTON — President Obama signed an executive order on Wednesday to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from $7.25 an hour for federal contract workers starting in 2015, a promise he made in his State of the Union address last month.“We are a nation that believes in rewarding honest work with honest wages,” Mr. Obama said Wednesday in a letter announcing the move. “And America deserves a raise.”Mr. Obama promised a “year of action” in his January speech, and he urged Congress to pass a bill raising the minimum wage for all workers to $10.10 an hour. The federally required wage is now $7.25 an hour. More than 20 states have raised their minimum wages above the level required by federal law.The minimum wage was last raised in 2009, to $7.25 from $6.55.Republicans argue that raising wages would dampen the economy and shrink hiring by small businesses.
