To connect people to the internet, Silicon Valley companies have cooked up various ideas, including the use of drones and hot air balloons to beam web access to all.Microsoft has another technology to help with connectivity that it is now taking the wraps off: unused channels between television broadcasts, known as white spaces, writes Cecilia Kang, a technology reporter for The New York Times.Under Microsoft’s plan, which the software company rolled out on Tuesday, it will start a broadband service using white space technology in 12 states. The technology itself uses low-powered television channels to cover long distances and can penetrate obstacles like concrete walls.Microsoft said its new plan would help rural Americans — many of whom live in remote areas that haven’t had fast internet service — get exactly that kind of service. The company is positioning white space technology as a potential way to plug the digital divide.There are, of course, a few problems with the plan. The hurdles include a lack of devices that can work on white space technology and opposition from television broadcasters that worry that their own broadcasts may face interference if people are getting online through unused television channels.Microsoft seems undeterred. White space technology is “the best solution for reaching over 80 percent of people in rural America who lack broadband today,” said Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith.
