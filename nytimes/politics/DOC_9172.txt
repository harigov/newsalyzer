TOULOUSE, France — Inside a 185-acre assembly hall in this quiet corner of southwestern France, a dozen of Airbus’s best-selling wide-body jets stand in various stages of construction.Each station is a hive of activity as 1,800 mechanics, working in two daily shifts, churn out 10 or so of the twin-engine A330s each month, from components flown in from Airbus sites in France, Britain, Germany and Spain. Through the unfinished windows of empty green fuselages wafts a muffled mix of European pop tunes accompanied by the rhythmic pulse and swoosh of automated welding machines.Over the last two decades, nearly 1,100 finished A330s have emerged from this building, their tails bearing the logos of more than 100 airlines from 40 countries. But with the advent of a new generation of lightweight, carbon-fiber wide-bodies like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’s own A350-XWB, which is expected later this year, the A330 is starting to show its age.So Airbus is poised to move forward with a major, multibillion-dollar plan to design and execute an upgrade for the A330, people close to the deliberations said on Friday. An announcement is possible as early as Monday, the first day of the Farnborough International Airshow, near London.In recent weeks, Airbus has presented several airline customers with details of a new version of the plane, which would be fitted with new engines and more aerodynamic wings that would reduce the A330’s fuel consumption by as much as 15 percent. The people who described those plans spoke on the condition of anonymity because the board of the Airbus Group, the plane maker’s parent company, had not yet formally approved the decision.The management of Airbus has spent at least six months deliberating whether to revamp the A330 or simply let the plane glide into retirement while the company spends its time and money producing and marketing newer aircraft.Analysts and investors have argued that extending the life of the A330 would help maintain a valuable source of cash for Airbus at a time when less mature aircraft — like the twin-deck A380, or the A350 — are still years away from recouping their development costs.And given the teething pains that often accompany new aircraft — consider the early problems with the Boeing 787’s lithium batteries, or the cracks found in parts of the A380’s wings — many airlines say they would be quicker to embrace a derivative of the A330’s proven design.While the A330 continues to generate around 40 percent of Airbus’s civilian aircraft profits, new orders for the plane have slowed significantly in recent years. Airbus’s current backlog of unfilled orders for the A330 amounts to just 250 planes. While that is equivalent to about two years of production at current rates, it is only a small fraction of the current industry-average backlog of more than eight years.A decision to upgrade the A330 would follow a similar move by Airbus four years ago to revamp its short-range, single-aisle workhorse, the A320, which was followed by Boeing a year later with an upgrade of its competing 737. The approach has proved successful for both companies, sustaining demand for both planes beyond the middle of the next decade.But some analysts warn that the economic case for an A330 revamp is less compelling than it is for those smaller jets, and risks tying up research and development capabilities that could be more profitably deployed elsewhere.“It’s not a no-brainer,” said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, a London brokerage firm. “There’s a lot of risk and resource implications.”After several bumper years of new commercial aircraft orders, Airbus and Boeing are heading into the Farnborough show — the world’s largest aerospace bazaar — with order books already overstuffed with demand for their latest single-aisle jets, as well as new fuel-sipping wide-bodies that promise operating-cost savings of up to 15 percent over older models.But with the wait times to receive new planes now stretching to more than six years, airlines have been slower to reach for their checkbooks. Despite an improving global economy and a stronger earnings outlook — airlines worldwide expect combined profits of $18 billion this year, up from nearly $11 billion last year — the number of orders to be announced at Farnborough is expected to be relatively subdued.Neither Boeing nor Airbus has any all-new aircraft models on the drawing board. That is all the more reason an update of the aging A330 could draw widespread interest.The closest parallel might be Boeing’s decision late last year to offer an updated version of its popular 777, which entered service in 1995. The renovated versions will seat up to 400 passengers, compared with 300 to 350 now, and will be equipped with General Electric engines that promise to cut fuel consumption by 12 percent.Boeing has won orders for more than 250 of the planes, known as the 777X, which are expected to enter service beginning in 2020.Some say Airbus could lure customers for as many as 1,000 revamped wide-body planes, enough to keep the A330’s assembly line in Toulouse humming until the end of the next decade. A number of top customers — including Delta Air Lines and the Malaysian-based low-cost carrier AirAsia X, as well as major jet-leasing companies like the Los Angeles-based Air Lease Corporation — have expressed keen interest in an upgraded A330, particularly if the planes can be delivered sooner than rival models.The new version of the A330, which would be expected to enter service by 2020, would include up to 10 additional seats and be fitted with new engines built by Rolls-Royce of Britain, the people with knowledge of the planning said. The engines would be similar in design to one that the company developed for the Boeing 787, a person with knowledge of the plans said.Representatives of Airbus and Rolls-Royce declined to comment on Friday.“I think the A330 definitely has a place in this market, and careful, tailored upgrades will probably stretch the relevance of the product at least another 10 years,” said Michel Merluzeau, a managing partner of G2 Solutions, an aerospace consultancy in Kirkland, Wash.Analysts say a revamped A330 would probably not be able to compete with the fuel economy of Boeing’s three-year-old 787 Dreamliner or with the updated 777, which in addition to new engines will have lighter wings made of carbon fiber instead of aluminum.Other design adjustments to the A330, like improving its wings, could be made to further enhance its performance, but analysts still say Airbus would be obliged to offer the plane at a significant discount to its newer peers.A more attractive price tag, combined with earlier availability — analysts say a revamped A330 could be ready for service in four years — would probably attract a wide range of customers.That might entice emerging markets like China and India, for which Boeing’s 787 and 777, and even Airbus’s A350 have until now remained out of reach — all of those jets have list prices of $250 million or more. Current versions of the A330 list for $215 million to $240 million."There is potential in the passenger and cargo markets, and even with some military markets,” Mr. Merluzeau said. “I think sufficient demand could be accomplished at attractive price points while addressing the concerns of airlines."Still, a revamped A330 would burn around 15 percent more fuel than its newer competitors, meaning that it could be a tough sell, even at a discount."Will you end up selling any more than you would have if you stuck with the old version and cut the price?” asked Mr. Cunningham, the London analyst. He noted that the current low interest-rate environment was already reducing customers’ sensitivity to list price, while the recent instability in the Middle East was refocusing attention on the risk of rising oil prices.Damien Lasou, a managing director and aerospace analyst at the Paris office of the management consulting firm Accenture, added that, unlike the choices in the single-aisle market, which is almost evenly split between Boeing’s 737 and Airbus A320, airlines face a much wider menu of long-range wide-body options to choose from. Therefore, there is some risk that an incremental A330 upgrade could become a niche aircraft with a limited potential customer base.“There is much more fragmentation” of the wide-body jet market, Mr. Lasou said. “Each aircraft type is covering a smaller range of routes. The market is becoming much more specialized.”But judging from the preponderance of freshly painted logos from Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on the planes being built in Toulouse, the A330’s appeal in the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets remains strong. If a revamped version manages to extend that demand still further, the thrum inside these factory walls might be heard for years to come.
