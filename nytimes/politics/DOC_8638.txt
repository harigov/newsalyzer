BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Syrian dissidents on Sunday formally established a broad-based national council designed to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad’s government, which they accused of pushing the country to the brink of civil war.The announcement of the Syrian National Council at a news conference in Istanbul appeared to be the most serious step yet to unify a fragmented opposition.Burhan Ghalioun, a prominent Syrian opposition figure who read out the founding statement of the council in Istanbul, accused the government of fomenting sectarian strife in Syria to maintain its grip on power.A group of activists had declared the preliminary formation of the council last month, but its structure, its goals and a founding statement signed by major opposition factions had not been announced until this conference.Members said the council included representatives from the Damascus Declaration group, a pro-democracy network; the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, a banned Islamic political party; various Kurdish factions; the Local Coordination Committees, a group that helps organize and document protests; and other independent and tribal figures.
