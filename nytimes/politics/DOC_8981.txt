The Saudi king’s advisory council has recommended that the government lift its ban on female drivers — but only for women over 30, who must be off the road by 8 p.m., cannot wear makeup behind the wheel and require a male relative’s permission, a member of the council said Friday. The government does not have to accept the recommendations, but the council’s decision to make them was a startling shift in the kingdom that for years has staunchly rejected any review of the ban. The council member said the Shura Council made the recommendations in a secret session held in the past month. The member spoke on the condition of anonymity because the recommendations had not been made public. There have been small but increasingly bold protests by women who took to their cars over the past year. The driving ban, which is unique in the world, is imposed because the kingdom’s ultraconservative Muslim clerics say “licentiousness” will spread if women drive. The ban is part of the general restrictions imposed on women based on a strict interpretation of Shariah.
