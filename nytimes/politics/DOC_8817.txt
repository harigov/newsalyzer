CAIRO —  Six days after the crash of a Russian charter flight from the Egyptian resort area of Sharm el Sheikh, the government of Egypt is finding itself increasingly isolated in its resistance to the possibility that a terrorist’s bomb brought down the plane.Britain has concluded the cause was most likely a bomb. President Obama has said pointedly that he takes the possibility “very seriously.” After standing arm in arm with Egypt for six days in discouraging any such discussion of terrorism, even President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday suspended Russia’s flights to Egypt for fear of another attack, stranding tens of thousands of tourists at the resort.But the government of Egypt, critically dependent on the money tourists bring to Sharm el Sheikh’s resorts, has dismissed any suggestion that a bombing killed the 224 people aboard as “premature,” “surprising” and “unwarranted.”The widening chasm between Egypt and the world, some say, recalls an earlier crash, in 1999, when EgyptAir Flight 990 plunged into the ocean off the coast of Nantucket Island. Although American investigators said flight records pointed to the decisions of an Egyptian pilot, the Egyptian government blamed a malfunction in the Boeing airplane, and 17 years later the Egyptian-American dispute over the cause is still unresolved.In that case, the Egyptian investigation was cloaked in mystery and, critics say, politicized from that start.“I don’t anticipate the Egyptian investigation here to be any more transparent than their work on EgyptAir 990,” James E. Hall, the former head of the National Transportation Safety Board who oversaw that investigation, said in an interview.The desires of Egypt’s political leaders to minimize the threat of terrorism would almost certainly set the course of its investigators, he said. “The air safety investigators in Egypt are under the thumb of the government,” he said, “and I don’t think that has changed.”Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has declared most forcefully that a bomb is the most likely explanation. He took the extraordinary step this week of suspending flights in and out of the airport for more than 24 hours, until new security measures could be put in place. About 20,000 British citizens are in Sharm el Sheikh, and many were scrambling to get home on Friday morning as flights resumed.Several British news outlets, citing anonymous officials, reported on Friday that the British government based its conclusion about a bombing in part on telephone surveillance of Egyptian militants in the Sinai Peninsula, and reports focused on the chance that an airport employee might have planted an explosive.Mr. Obama, for his part, raised the same possibility on Thursday night in a radio interview. “There is a possibility that there was a bomb on board,” he said. “And we are taking that very seriously.”Russia appeared to switch sides on Friday, suspending all flights to Egypt, pending a conclusion of the crash investigation. It was the first breach in what had largely been a consistent response from Russian and Egyptian authorities.A Kremlin spokesman said that Mr. Putin’s decision did not necessarily mean that the crash was caused by a terrorist act, and Russian officials did not say whether the decision to suspend flights was based on new information from the investigation.Under international aviation rules, representatives from France, Ireland, Russia and Germany are included in the official committee investigating the crash because of various connections to the plane or the flight, and European officials briefed on the inquiry say others in the committee have urged the Egyptians to disclose more.But the rules give the Egyptians control over any public statements, and so far Egypt has rebuffed admonitions to disclose any preliminary details of what they may have learned, including whether explosive residue had been detected, the pattern of burn marks on the wreckage or on human remains, or of whatever may have been gleaned from the plane’s flight-recording devices.A statement from Egypt’s Ministry of Aviation on Friday conveyed mainly pique at the British for not only suspending their flights but also requiring separate planes to carry passengers’ checked baggage home.“The British airlines opt to fly without the hold baggage of the British passengers,” Hossam Kamal, the minister of civil aviation, said in the statement.“The airport will not accommodate more than 120 tons of left-behind luggage,” he added. “This big volume affects the smooth operation of the rest of the domestic and international flights.” The burden of the British baggage, he suggested, had caused the airport to reduce the number of British departures to eight instead of the 19 flights previously scheduled, thus prolonging the plight of the stranded vacationers.Some who remembered the investigation of EgyptAir F light 990 saw a recurring pattern.Hosni Mubarak, then Egypt’s president, initially requested that Washington take the lead in the investigation, given the proximity to the United States and the difficulty of recovering the underwater wreckage.The evidence quickly pointed to a suicidal decision by one pilot, Gamil al-Batouti. He was heard on the voice recorder encouraging the captain and another co-pilot to leave him alone in the cockpit. He cut the engine, turned the plane into a nosedive toward the sea and repeated to himself again and again, “I rely on God.”The plane’s speed neared the barrier of sound, and Mr. Batouti evidently struggled against another pilot’s last-minute efforts to stop its descent, as William Langewiesche, a journalist and pilot, later documented in an article for The Atlantic in 2001. An F.B.I. investigation determined that Mr. Batouti was facing public humiliation over accusations of sexual impropriety, including exposing himself to teenage girls and masturbating in public.But as soon as the evidence began to emerge, Mr. Mubarak recalled his initial representative to the investigating committee, Mamdouh Hashment, a senior aviation official.“Mubarak replaced that team with another team that would follow the government line,” said Mr. Hall, the former National Transportation Safety Board chief. “It made it a very long and trying investigation, which it really did not need to be.”Egypt’s new representatives sought at every turn to block any conclusion that held the pilot, Mr. Batouti, responsible. They repeatedly invented and advocated increasingly esoteric scenarios, demanding costly and time-consuming high-velocity tests to disprove each thesis.At home, the Egyptian state media floated conspiracy theories about American, Israeli or other plots that might have brought down the plane, which was carrying dozens of Egyptian military officers. Mr. Batouti was labeled a “martyr” in the Egyptian press, and the Egyptian aviation authorities — dissenting from the Americans — ultimately pronounced the crash a mechanical failure.“The government would have viewed this exactly as it would, for example, an Islamic terrorist act in Luxor — something that we should cover up,” Hani Shukrallah, a veteran Egyptian journalist, told Mr. Langewiesche. “So it got politicized immediately. And this became an official line: You are out there to prove that EgyptAir is not responsible. It became a national duty.”In an interview on Friday, Mr. Shukrallah said the Egyptian government was just as determined to cover up the possibility of terrorism in the Russian plane crash: “Oh yes, definitely!” he said.“There is a sense — which everyone familiar with Egyptian airports is aware of — that the security precautions are not as they should be,” he added.The fragile state of Egypt’s economy makes any conclusion of terrorism extraordinarily costly. Sharm el Sheikh had been a bright spot for the nearly moribund Egyptian tourism industry at a time when a deep deficit in its balance of trade has forced Egypt to the brink of a currency crisis. Tourism, especially in Sharm el Sheikh, has long been one of its four main sources of hard currency (the others are petroleum exports, foreign aid and remittances from migrant workers abroad).Russians and Britons had been the two largest groups of tourists in Sharm el Sheikh, and with their departure, analysts warn a further drop in tourist revenues could have a devastating impact on the economy as whole. The government has already imposed strict controls on the movement of hard currency out of the country, even at the cost of making it difficult for businesses to obtain raw materials and other goods.But despite the economic stakes, managing the crash inquiry could prove harder this time, because of the international representatives on the investigating committee. The results of the EgyptAir Flight 990 inquiry place an added burden on the Egyptian investigation this time, analysts said.“The international community is not going to give Egypt the benefit of the doubt,” said Michael Wahid Hanna, a researcher based at the Century Foundation in New York.So if the cause of the crash was not a bomb and Egypt hopes to dispel the Western fears, “this is going to have to be an investigation that is of the utmost professionalism and really transparent,” he said.“They are going to have to go about this in a way that is quite different from the past,” he added.
