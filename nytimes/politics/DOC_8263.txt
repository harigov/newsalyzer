MIAMI — Senator Marco Rubio, who stumbled badly in a bid for the Republican presidential nomination and then jumped back into the race for his Senate seat, was re-elected on Tuesday to a second term.The senator, a Cuban-American conservative, fended off a forceful challenge by Representative Patrick Murphy, 33, a Democrat who consistently portrayed Mr. Rubio as an absentee lawmaker with misplaced allegiances — first to the presidency instead of to his job, and then to Donald J. Trump.In an election pitting two young, ambitious strivers, Mr. Rubio, who had vowed not to seek re-election to the Senate, was by far the better-known, better-financed candidate. Mr. Rubio began his career in the Florida Statehouse, where he became speaker. But the race proved surprisingly tight as Mr. Rubio, 45, struggled to characterize his support for Mr. Trump, his onetime opponent in the presidential primary contests. Mr. Trump bested Mr. Rubio in the Florida primary and ridiculed him as “Little Marco.” Even as Mr. Rubio endorsed Mr. Trump, who is highly unpopular among Hispanics, a crucial constituency for the senator, he mostly avoided mentioning him on the stump.A moderate South Florida congressman, Mr. Murphy was depicted by Mr. Rubio as overprivileged and overly reliant on his father’s fortune and connections. Mr. Murphy, one of the youngest candidates to run in a high-profile Senate race, was in turn accused of inflating his résumé and accomplishing little in Congress during his two terms.The two candidates took opposite tacks on a number of issues, with Mr. Murphy supporting abortion rights, a minimum-wage increase, the Affordable Care Act and an end to the United States’ economic embargo on Cuba.
