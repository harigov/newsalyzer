LONDON, Nov. 23 — The former Russian spy who fell gravely ill early this month, apparently after being poisoned, died Thursday night after suffering a heart attack, the authorities said.But the circumstances leading to the death of the former spy, 43-year-old Alexander V. Litvinenko, remained murky and confused. Although the police initially said the case was one of “deliberate poisoning,” on Thursday they said only that they were investigating the matter as “an unexplained death.” Doctors at University College Hospital, where Mr. Litvinenko was being treated and which announced the death, said they still did not know why he had fallen so ill.“Despite extensive tests, we are still unclear as to the cause of his condition,” Dr. Geoff Bellingham, chief of critical care at the hospital, told reporters. He ruled out two earlier hypotheses: that he had been poisoned by thallium, a toxic heavy metal, or by a radioactive material.Mr. Litvinenko, who told the authorities that he fell ill on Nov. 1 after meeting with two Russians, and then with an Italian security consultant, became sicker as the weeks went on.Friends of Mr. Litvinenko, a onetime K.G.B. agent who became a vocal opponent of the Russian government, say that Russian agents killed him. He was silenced, they say, because of his continual digging into Russian affairs. Both the Kremlin and Russia’s foreign intelligence service have denied being behind Mr. Litvinenko’s fatal illness. A Kremlin spokesman called the accusations “sheer nonsense.”
