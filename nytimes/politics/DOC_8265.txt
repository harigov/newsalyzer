CHICAGO — Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, who had been seen as perhaps the most imperiled incumbent Republican in the Senate, on Tuesday lost his job to Representative Tammy Duckworth, putting both of the state’s Senate seats in the control of Democrats.Mr. Kirk, a centrist Republican with bipartisan alliances, has long walked a delicate line in a state that tends to vote for Democrats, especially in presidential election years. It is a model that has seen success in Illinois in past decades but that has grown increasingly tangled in this battering election year. Some of Mr. Kirk’s stances have appealed to Democrats and independents (he has supported gay rights, for instance), but he has risked annoying his Republican base along the way. (He said he would support Donald J. Trump if he were the party’s presidential nominee but then backed away from him.)It did not help Mr. Kirk’s chances that only days before the election, he seemed to denigrate the background of Ms. Duckworth, 48, a military veteran who lost her legs in the Iraq war after the Black Hawk helicopter she was co-piloting was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade in 2004. Ms. Duckworth was born in Bangkok to a Thai mother of Chinese descent, and her father was a Vietnam War veteran. She has been in the House since 2013 and worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs before that.The re-election effort of Mr. Kirk, 57, a former Naval reservist who previously served in the House of Representatives, was complicated by a medical problem. Mr. Kirk had a stroke in January 2012, and he was sidelined for about a year during his first term in the Senate to undergo operations and rehabilitation.
