It is up 16 percent over that time and has climbed 18 percent this year, more than twice as much as the S.&P. 500, which tracks large companies.Deere, which makes agricultural and construction equipment, reported a bigger profit than analysts had expected although it had been hurt by slowing construction and low commodity prices, which caused farmers to buy less equipment. The stock advanced $10.16, or 11 percent, to $102.17, its highest closing price.Already trading at record highs, industrial companies continued to rise after Deere’s report.
