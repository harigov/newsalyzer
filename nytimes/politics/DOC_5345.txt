Paisley Park, Prince’s storied recording lair outside Minneapolis, has finally cut through the red tape to become a museum.Representatives of Paisley Park and Prince’s estate announced on Tuesday that the complex has “permanently opened its doors” as a museum, after receiving approval on Monday by the City Council of Chanhassen, Minn., where Paisley Park is located.Three weeks ago the Council decided to delay voting on a zoning change for the museum, citing concerns about traffic, parking and public safety — a move that complicated the opening of the museum, planned for just three days later.The Council granted Paisley Park a temporary permit that allowed a limited number of visits by the public, but the delay effectively muted what was to have been a splashy opening for the museum, which organizers expect to draw up to 600,000 visitors a year, a week before “The Official Prince Tribute Concert” in St. Paul.Prince died of an accidental overdose of painkillers in April, at age 57.According to an announcement by Paisley Park, tours of the museum will start again on Friday, and tickets for the remaining dates of 2016 are on sale at the museum’s website. Tickets for next year are expected to go on sale starting in “mid-November,” the museum said. The museum’s tours — which cost $38.50 or $100 for a V.I.P. pass — promise a glimpse into Prince’s private working environment, as well as goodies from Prince’s personal archives like wardrobes, musical instruments and even motorcycles.Last week, Warner Bros. Records and NPG Records, Prince’s label, announced a hits collection, “Prince 4Ever,” due Nov. 22, and a deluxe reissue of Prince’s classic “Purple Rain” containing an entire second album of unreleased material, to be released next year.
