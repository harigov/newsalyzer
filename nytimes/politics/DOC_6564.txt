The congressional primary season essentially draws to a close on Tuesday with contests in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, ending a long slog of state races that produced few upsets despite the volatile electorate.In Delaware, Democrats will choose their candidate to replace the state’s sole House member, Representative John Carney, who is running for governor. It is a six-way race, with polling scant in the state, but the Democratic contender will be a heavy favorite to win in November.Among the perceived front-runners are Lisa Blunt Rochester, the former state labor secretary who has the chance to be both the first woman and African-American sent to Congress by Delaware voters. Also on the ballot are Bryan Townsend, a state senator, and Sean Barney, an Iraq war veteran who has drawn support from veterans groups.In New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte is expected to easily win the Republican Senate primary and officially become the candidate for her competitive race against Maggie Hassan, the Democratic governor. In the state’s First Congressional District, Representative Frank Guinta, who has faced scrutiny for campaign finance violations, is in a tough race against fellow Republican Rich Ashooh.In Rhode Island, two Democratic House incumbents are expected to prevail easily.There are still a few loose ends. A federal judge has ordered a special Republican congressional primary in New York’s Third District for Oct. 6. And Louisiana will conduct its first round of congressional elections on Election Day, Nov. 8, with runoffs held on Dec. 10 in cases where no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote.
