WASHINGTON — As Democratic Congressional leaders try to round up the votes to remake the health care system, they face a range of concerns about the cost and scope of the legislation among centrist lawmakers in each party whose support is vital to a deal.Representative Charlie Melancon, Democrat of Louisiana, suspects that a proposed government-run health insurance plan will be another unaffordable “entitlement program” that puts a stranglehold on the federal budget and on future generations.Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, expresses fears that the health care legislation could inadvertently cause some Americans to lose their existing coverage. And he wants to be sure that any bill includes new “incentives for healthy lifestyles.”Representative Mike Ross, Democrat of Arkansas, wants to reduce or eliminate the disparities in what Medicare pays for health services in rural areas versus urban centers, a gap that he says has forced hospitals to close and doctors to move away.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, worries about requiring employers to provide insurance to workers. Without categorically rejecting the idea, she said: “My inclination is to oppose an employer mandate. Employers want to provide health insurance and do so if they can afford it.”Many of the centrists said they shared the same concerns: that the legislation proposed so far is too expensive; does not sufficiently reduce health care costs over the long term; and would raise taxes too much, or in ways they oppose.If there is one thing centrists in the House and the Senate agree on, it is that they are being pushed way too fast to act on a hugely complex bill with an astronomical price tag of roughly $1 trillion over 10 years, prompting a loud chorus of demands to slow down.But aside from taking more time, and missing President Obama’s deadline of having each chamber pass a health care bill before the August recess — a goal that seems impossible to meet — getting to “yes” will require an artful set of compromises.In many cases, the concerns of centrist lawmakers reflect conflicting goals: to expand health coverage to nearly all Americans while reducing the growth of health spending, cutting the cost of the bill and minimizing new taxes.In the House, a group of seven Democrats who are members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition have stalled the proceedings of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the last of three House panels needed to approve the bill.The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Wednesday that she shared some of the group’s concerns but also said, “I have no question that we have the votes on the floor of the House to pass this legislation” — a remark that some took as a threat to barrel ahead.“Why are we rushing it?” asked Mr. Melancon, a Blue Dog on the Energy and Commerce Committee. “Let’s get it right.”And he effectively dared House leaders to press ahead without fully addressing his group’s concerns, noting that the Blue Dogs potentially had enough votes in Energy and Commerce to stall the bill and that leaders would have to resort to pressure tactics.“We’re going to need some orthopedists around here to take care of the broken bones and twisted arms,” he said.The best hope for a bipartisan compromise seems to lie with a small group of lawmakers in the Senate Finance Committee, which continued to meet on Wednesday.The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and a centrist with a long history of collaborating with Republicans, has resisted pressure from Senate leaders and the White House while insisting that a compromise is within reach.Republicans on that committee, including Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, are insisting that any new taxes to help pay for the legislation come from within the health care arena. They have expressed no interest in the income surtax, on high-earners, proposed by the House that would raise $544 billion over 10 years and instead are exploring a menu of smaller items including  fees on private insurers.Last week, a bipartisan group of senators, including two on the Finance Committee, sent a letter to the Senate leadership pleading for more time. A number of other senators have said they want the panel to continue working carefully toward a deal.Ms. Collins, who joined Democrats in supporting the economic stimulus measure  this year, said she had several big concerns about the House health care bill and a separate measure approved last week on a party-line vote by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.She said that she was “very skeptical” of the new government health insurance plan that Democrats want to create, and that she was “not a proponent of an employer mandate,” which would require employers to provide health benefits to workers or pay a fee to the government.Instead, she said, “I would like to encourage more employer coverage by giving generous tax credits to smaller businesses.”As for reaching a deal, Ms. Collins said, “we have a long way to go.”The Senate Finance Committee has been working on a compromise idea that would create private nonprofit health insurance cooperatives instead of a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers in an effort to reduce costs.Mr. Ross, of Arkansas, said the House Blue Dogs were open to considering the co-op idea and any number of other proposals that might reduce the cost of the legislation while still expanding insurance coverage to most Americans.At a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, the Blue Dogs said, they won agreement from the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Representative Henry Waxman of California, to try to curtail Medicare spending by giving the executive branch new power to set annual payment rates for doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, based on recommendations from an independent advisory council.Rates are now set by statutory formulas, and Congress is besieged by lobbyists pleading for bigger increases each year.But Mr. Ross said that addressing long-term costs was just one area of concern for the Blue Dogs. They also want to reduce or eliminate the disparity in Medicare payments that result in lower rates for health providers in rural areas.Mr. Ross said his hometown, Prescott, now has three doctors — down from six — and that private insurers in Arkansas pay 30 percent more than Medicare, making doctors reluctant to accept new Medicare patients.
