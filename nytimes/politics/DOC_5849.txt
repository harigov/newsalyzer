The following excerpts are from an interview about how to defeat the Islamic State with two former jihadists: Maajid Nawaz, a former recruiter for the radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, and Mubin Shaikh, a former extremist from Canada who spent time with the Taliban before turning away from radical Islam.Maajid Nawaz“There is no point in denying it. The statement that this has nothing to do with Islam is disingenuous. It’s as unhelpful as saying this is in essence Islam.”“We need to have a candid conversation about this and recognize that there is a correlation between scripture and this. There are also geopolitical issues, yes — but there is also a relationship with scripture.”“What I understood to be the correct reading of Islam was in fact just one of many historical interpretations that existed out there. The theological pluralism that used to exist has been lost among angry young Muslims.”“We cannot shoot our way out of this.”Mubin Shaikh“Of course I believe it is the word of God — absolutely it is the speech of God, 100 percent. But my counterargument is this: Do you think that God is confined to the sociopolitical culture of the 700s? Their argument goes, ‘So who are you to change these interpretations?’ But the counterargument is you’re in fact not changing anything. You’re respecting the fact that the revelations were sent in a very particular context.”When the Quran says, “‘Prepare your steeds for war,’ this is one of the exhortations to military readiness. How come you interpret that to mean today it’s tanks and machine guns and blah blah? Why aren’t you using swords, spears and shields? So you recognize that there is an element of modernization already. So you can pick and choose. Otherwise, where’s your donkey? Why aren’t you riding your mule?”
