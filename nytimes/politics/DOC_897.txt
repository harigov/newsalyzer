The United States government is close to issuing a rule that will for the first time require banks and other financial institutions to find out the identities of people hidden behind shell companies.The rule is meant to close a major loophole in the American banking system that enables the sorts of secretive financial maneuvers that were thrust into the spotlight this week with the leak of millions of documents from a law firm in Panama.That firm, Mossack Fonseca, is one of the largest incorporators of shell companies in the world. The trove of leaked documents — analyzed by more than 100 news organizations worldwide — revealed offshore companies tied to 143 politicians, their families and close associates.The documents also showed scores of shell companies doing business with major international banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and HSBC, that rely on access to the American banking system.Under federal regulations, banks with American branches in the United States are required to “know their customers” who open accounts in the United States. But those rules have been significantly weakened because banks have not been required to know the identities of customers who set up accounts in names of shell companies.The government’s proposed customer due diligence rule, or C.D.D., is an attempt to close that loophole, a senior Treasury official said in an interview.“I don’t think everyone recognizes the connection between the C.D.D. and the Panama Papers,” said the official, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.The new rule, she said, “would clarify and make absolutely clear to our financial institutions that they must know and understand the beneficial ownership of their customers,” she said. “We already know that they need to know their customer, but where that customer is a legal entity, we are clarifying that they need to know and understand the beneficial owner of that customer. Who is actually calling the shots? Who stands to gain?”The United States has been considered a laggard in the global push to shine light on the murky world of shell companies.For one thing, the United States allows its states to register limited liability companies and other structures without requiring the names of the actual people behind those companies. In addition, the know-your-customer loophole has let banks decide whether they will expend the resources to pierce the secrecy of shell companies that set up accounts.The new Treasury rule will require banks to find out the identities of any individuals who own 25 percent or more of corporate entities that open bank accounts, as well as any individuals exercising control over those entities.The banking loophole was highlighted last year in an investigative series in The New York Times, “Towers of Secrecy,” which focused on the use of shell companies in United States real estate.The Times’s findings, government officials have said, helped move several reforms forward, including the customer due diligence rule, which had been in the works for more than four years. The final step — approval by the Office of Management and Budget — is to begin shortly and typically does not last more than three months.The Panama documents included emails showing that the law firm and the banks had trouble sorting out who was responsible for discovering the identities of people behind shell companies.David Schwartz, chief executive of the Florida International Bankers Association, said that many banks were already trying to identify the people behind shell companies, but that they had been hampered by the lack of the requirement.In addition, he said, it would be easier for banks if the locations where shell companies are incorporated — often states in the United States — were required to find out who the owners are.Wyoming and Nevada have gotten renewed scrutiny this week because Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian firm, set up offices there.Carlos Garcia-Pavia, a director at LexisNexis Risk Solutions who focuses on money laundering, said that banking due diligence had become more complicated as individuals had started setting up shell companies all over the world, rather than using corporate structures based where they live.The details of the Treasury’s new rule will be important to its effectiveness. Organizations pushing for greater transparency in shell companies have said that an earlier version of the rule defined control of shell companies in a way that might allow managers, rather than owners, of a company to be listed.They have also expressed concerns about whether bank customers who provide faulty information will be held accountable, and whether the forms submitted about the beneficial owners will let banks off the hook from doing more investigating.Ms. Shasky Calvery said the Treasury had been working closely with members of Congress who have proposed legislation to require states to maintain registries of shell company owners.She also said that a Treasury program that tracks people who use shell companies to purchase expensive real estate in New York and Miami was underway and that she had noticed people trying to find ways to avoid reporting the information to the department.“It does make me wonder if it’s the person turning around before the D.U.I. checkpoint,” she said.
