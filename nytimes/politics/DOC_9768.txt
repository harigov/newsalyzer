Dear Diary:I was on my way to a biochemistry midterm at Columbia. I left my Upper West Side apartment with the usual gear: several pens and pencils, a pair of earplugs and my father’s plastic watch with a big second hand.I was a block from home when I realized that the second hand had stopped. It was after 5 p.m., and the repair shop on my route to the campus was closed.Panicking, I walked into an upscale clothing store at 112th Street and Broadway and asked if they had any watches for sale. I explained my predicament to the store clerk: I had an exam in 20 minutes and desperately needed a way to keep track of time.He did have two watches for sale, but both cost more than $100.A woman in the store who had overheard the conversation joined in.“Here,” she said, removing the watch from her wrist. “You can borrow mine. I’ll write down my address for you on a slip of paper.”The watch kept perfect time during the exam. I returned it to her the next day strapped to a box of cookies.
