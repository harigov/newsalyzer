Donald J. Trump broke his silence on Thursday about the Supreme Court’s decision to block parts of a Texas law restricting abortion access, promising that such outcomes would be different if he was elected president.In an interview with Mike Gallagher, a talk radio host, Mr. Trump said that the ruling was another reason skeptical conservatives should back his candidacy. The next president is expected to appoint at least one Supreme Court justice and maybe more.“Even if you dislike Donald Trump, I’m going to put great conservative justices on,” Mr. Trump said.He added: “If Scalia was living or Scalia was replaced by me, you wouldn’t have had that,” Mr. Trump said of the Texas decision. “It would have been the opposite.”In fact, the outcome of the 5-to-3 decision would not have been different if Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, were still on the bench.The court remains short-handed because Republicans have refused to hold a vote on Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Obama’s nominee to replace Justice Scalia. Mr. Trump warned on Thursday that if Hillary Clinton were elected president, the court would lurch even more to the left.“If she gets in, you won’t even have to bother going to court — you’re going to know the answer,” Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees last month, acknowledged that sometimes justices become less conservative over time. In an unusual move for a candidate, he singled out Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. as a turncoat for failing to overturn the Affordable Care Act.“Roberts, he could have killed it twice and he didn’t,” Mr. Trump said. “To me, it’s almost not recoverable from his standpoint. Very, very sad.”
