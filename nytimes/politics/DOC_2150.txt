WASHINGTON, May 8  â€” After nearly three years of pushing China to let its currency float more freely, with only modest results, the Bush administration still appears reluctant to accuse China of manipulating its exchange rate.On Wednesday, the Treasury Department plans to release its latest assessment of Chinese foreign exchange practices and declare whether or not they represent a form of manipulation aimed at artificially increasing Chinese exports.A decision to officially brand China a manipulator would require the administration to formally open negotiations with the government in Beijing, but its main effect would be as a signal to currency markets that the United States wants the dollar to decline in value.American manufacturers and many members of Congress have complained for years that China has kept its currency, the yuan, at an artificially low exchange rate to the dollar as a way of selling its exports at cheap prices.Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has resisted demands to threaten Beijing, arguing that Chinese leaders are making "progress" toward a more flexible exchange rate and a more open financial system.This week, a Treasury official again emphasized  China's steps toward openness."If you look at what China is doing in exercising their commitment on putting in place a foreign-exchange regime that has greater flexibility," Mr. Snow's principal  spokesman, Tony Fratto, told reporters on Monday, "you see some evidence that they're doing that."But changes in the yuan's value have been relatively minor. Chinese leaders let the yuan climb about 2 percent against the dollar last July, and another similarly small amount more recently.When President Hu Jintao visited President Bush in Washington last month, top Chinese officials re-emphasized a need for "stability" and offered no hint of when they might  let the yuan move more freely.C. Fred Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics, warned that Mr. Snow would lose credibility and cede control over the issue to  members of Congress who support punitive measures against China."If they don't label the Chinese," Mr. Bergsten said, "they lose complete control of the issue to Congress, at which point you give Congress almost a free license to do what it wants."Supporters of calling China a currency manipulator contend that it would bring significant new pressure on the country's leaders to stop a practice that is aggravating global imbalances and unfairly undermining some American manufacturers by making it much harder for them to compete against Chinese goods.The United States' trade deficit with China ballooned to $202 billion in 2005, an imbalance that might ordinarily have pushed up the value of the yuan in relation to the dollar. China has prevented the yuan from rising by buying hundreds of billions  in dollar-denominated reserves.Opponents of name-calling say that labeling Beijing a currency manipulator  would probably harden Chinese resistance."What worries me is that it sets up a situation where any concession by China is seen as a gain for the United States," said Brad Setser, an international economist at Roubini Global Economics, a consulting firm in New York, "and leads to headlines saying that China caved under U.S. pressure."But the Bush administration risks looking as if it has capitulated to Chinese obstinacy  without getting much in return. Treasury officials contend that China has indeed moved toward modernization of its financial system, and they  say that the United States' broader interest is in opening the Chinese market to American financial services.Administration officials refused to predict what they will say on Wednesday, and it is possible that Mr. Snow will still decide to  label China a manipulator.But administration officials think they have other alternatives for stepping up pressure. Last month, the International  Monetary Fund agreed to take a more active role in resolving disputes about foreign exchange practices. In the past, the fund has held discussions with individual countries that seemed to be manipulating their currencies.Under the new approach, the I.M.F. would try to unravel disputes by bringing together officials from many different countries and looking for a coordinated set of actions.
