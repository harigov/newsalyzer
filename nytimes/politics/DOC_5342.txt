“Groundhog Day” is coming to Broadway. For the first time. Again.In a development fitting for a show about a man forced to relive the same day over and over, backers of the new musical on Wednesday re-announced their plan to transfer the production from London, where it opened on Tuesday.The musical’s Broadway prospects had become uncertain after its primary American backer, Scott Rudin, withdrew from the project in June.But this week’s opening, at the Old Vic Theater in London, was greeted with enthusiastic reviews and, in response to questions from reporters, the producers André Ptaszynski and Lia Vollack said they would bring the show to Broadway. But they did not say when, and a spokesman declined to say whether it would be this season.Mr. Ptaszynski, who is an executive with Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group, is the executive producer of “Matilda the Musical.” Ms. Vollack is an executive with Sony Pictures, which owns the rights to the “Groundhog Day” film from which the musical is adapted.“The intention is for ‘Groundhog Day’ to go to New York after the world premiere at The Old Vic in London,” they said in a statement. “The show is being produced on Broadway by Whistle Pig and Columbia Live Stage. Additional information will be announced at a later date.”
