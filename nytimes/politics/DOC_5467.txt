MOSCOW — Russia sought to distance itself on Wednesday from American accusations that it was responsible for the fiery destruction of a humanitarian convoy in Syria, with the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, also seeking to absolve Syria of responsibility for the attack.The charges and countercharges divided opinion in Russia, with some accusing the Syrian government and others blaming the United States. If there was any consensus, it was that the destruction of the much-needed aid convoy bound for rebel-held parts of Aleppo Province on Monday dealt a serious blow to already beleaguered attempts by the United States and Russian to find a way to work together on Syria.Mr. Lavrov, noting that the Russian Air Force had already announced that it had not hit the convoy, said the Syrians were not able to fly at night. “The Syrian Air Force could not have been at work, because the convoy was attacked during the hours of darkness,” Mr. Lavrov said from the United Nations General Assembly session in New York, speaking to Russia’s state-run Rossiya 1 television.Later on Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that a United States Predator drone had appeared in the area just minutes before the aid convoy was attacked. There was no immediate response from the Pentagon.Russia has said that its yearlong campaign of airstrikes in Syria has not caused a single civilian casualty, though the monitoring group airwars.org says it conservatively estimates the number at 3,000.Mr. Lavrov, in the excerpt from a longer interview broadcast by Rossiya 1, did not elaborate on who might have carried out the attack.Much of the convoy, carrying aid from government-controlled territory for 78,000 people in rebel-held territory in the western countryside of Aleppo Province, went up in flames. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement that “around 20 civilians” had been killed, including Omar Barakat, the local director of the Syria Red Crescent Society.Not everyone accepted the idea of absolving the Syrian government. The Novaya Gazeta newspaper, one of the few independent voices left in the Russian news media, blamed Damascus. Alexander Shumilin, a political scientist, wrote in the newspaper that Syria had “barbarously bombed” the convoy, probably dealing a death knell to diplomacy. “That means the escalation of the conflict,” he wrote.But much of the reaction in Russia blamed the United States. Numerous analysts found it suspicious that Washington had accused Russia of the attack so soon after the American military apologized for an airstrike that killed dozens of Syrian soldiers during last week’s cease-fire that had been negotiated by Mr. Lavrov and Secretary of State John Kerry.“It seems that such ill-conceived accusations that are not supported by facts are, among other things, designed to deflect attention away from a very strange ‘mistake’ made by pilots of an anti-Islamic State coalition headed by the United States,” said Roman Kudrin, a reporter commenting on state-backed Channel One.On social media, opponents of the Syrian government asserted that the attack on the convoy was in retaliation for the American strike on the soldiers, while supporters joked that if the United States could make “mistakes,” so, too, could the Syrian government.Some Russian commentators noted that the American establishment was divided over reaching an agreement with Russia on Syria. “This turns into a rather dangerous situation when agreements reached can eventually be not supported by the U.S. military,” Kirill Koktysh, a political analyst, wrote in the Sobesednik newspaper. “These are alarming symptoms that do not bring stability to the rest of the world.”Some blamed Syrian rebels for the attack, a position already suggested by the Russian Defense Ministry.An official from the Syrian Red Crescent Society, which helped organize the convoy, said in an interview with the state-run Izvestia daily that the rebels were responsible for the attack. The official was quoted as saying that there was no evidence that either the Russian or Syrian Air Force had struck columns with humanitarian aid.The daily Kommersant spoke to at least one expert who dismissed the idea that the destruction of 18 out of 31 trucks had been caused by fires lit by saboteurs on the ground.Kommersant noted that the predominate assessment, that the convoy was hit from the air, seemed to point to Damascus. The paper quoted experts saying that Russia would have difficulty convincing the world otherwise and that in defending Syria, Moscow risked bruising its image of being involved militarily in Syria to help end the conflict. Kommersant also concluded that the stage was set for the resumption of a full-scale war.The Obama administration said on Tuesday that it held Russia responsible, whether for conducting the strike itself or for failing to restrain Syria, although officials also said that their intelligence information indicated that Russia itself had bombed the convoy.The attack was the second calamity in three days that threatened to destroy the agreement between Russia and the United States. The deal included a weeklong cease-fire, humanitarian aid deliveries and cooperation between the two militaries in targeting extremist organizations in Syria. The longer-term goal was to establish enough trust to resume peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition.On Saturday, an American bombing run meant to hit Islamic State militants went awry, instead killing 60 people whom Damascus and its Russian allies identified as Syrian soldiers. Both Moscow and Damascus brushed aside apologies from Washington, suggesting that the attack was deliberate.Assessing the attack on the convoy, the Pentagon has determined with “very high probability” — given the United States’ ability to track all aircraft in the region using radar and other sensors — that a Russian Su-24 attack aircraft flew directly above the convoy less than a minute before the airstrike was reported, officials said. The plane was Russian, not Syrian, they said, while another said there were no indications of warplanes from other nations flying nearby at that time.The strike came shortly after the Syrian military announced that it regarded the seven-day partial cease-fire as over. Escorted by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the convoy was among the first under the agreement to deliver critical aid to the rebel-held areas.The air assault continued on Tuesday night with an airstrike on a medical clinic in a rebel-held area of Aleppo Province, a Paris-based coalition of medical organizations reported.The group, the International Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, said aircraft had attacked a clinic in Khan Touman, killing two ambulance drivers and two nurses, and demolishing the three-story building. It was feared that more bodies would be pulled from the rubble.Tawfik Chamaa, a Geneva-based spokesman for the group, said the airstrike appeared to have been carried out by Russian warplanes. The extent of the damage, he said, indicated that the attackers, “used sohisticated missiles which are held mainly by Russian forces.”While both Russia and Syria denied responsibility for the convoy attack, the Russian account shifted in the days after the assault.Some Russian officials first suggested that rebel artillery fire had ignited the convoy. Later, other officials speculated that the convoy had been set alight by some manner of sabotage. Then Russia’s Defense Ministry announced on Tuesday that a drone video showed terrorists driving a pickup truck armed with a mortar as part of the convoy. This suggested that the presence of the pickup truck had prompted the attack.But the drone video showed the aid convoy stationary, parked along the road, while what seems to be a truck towing a mortar drives past. There is no sense from the footage that the pickup is linked to the convoy, nor anything that would indicate why the aid might have become a military target.
