## Welcome to Newsalyzer

We live in a world where news is always breaking and in order to succeed we must be up to date. This constant flow of information has been optimized to get information and ideas into our brain and we absorb whatever biases that the writter or news source have.

Newsalyzer is a new tool that hopes to empower users to understand what kind of bias their news sources may have and suggest related articles on from news sources with different views. Since you are what you read we hope to help our users become balanced, informed, energetic people! 

Newsalyzer is the combination of two tools, our entity sentiment tool and our balanced articles tool.

The entity sentiment tool uses cutting edge natual langauge processing tooling to extract all the entities, rank them on importance in the document and provide them with a sentiment score(articles sentiment towards them). Using this information, users can see and understand what kind of biases(be it negative or positive)their news source may have towards topics, places, people, etc. Additionaly, if you click on the entity, we track sentiment and salience of a entity in said news source overtime. You can see when a news source went from utter support to verbal oposition with a few clicks!

The balanced article tool also uses cutting edge machine learning to cluster documents around topics and then recomend documents that have a similair topic but different origin. We hope that our users can leverage this to get out of their 'news bubble' and understand how people from other groups view the 'entities' in question. 


The goal is not to show people what is 'good news' or 'bad news'. The goal is to provide a tool to help people be more informed of news biases and consume a wider range of content. 


This is a work in progress and we always appreciate suggestions.
